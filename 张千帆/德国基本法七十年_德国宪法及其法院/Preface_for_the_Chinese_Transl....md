Preface for the Chinese Translation

Stefan Samse, Qianfan Zhang

Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS), Rule of Law Programme Asia and Peking University (PKU), Law Faculty are proud to jointly present the Chinese version of the collection of landmark decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. The editors of this book decided to come together to translate the entire volume of German constitutional law into Chinese, with the aim of providing access to one of the most influential documents in Germany to Chinese-speaking readers.

KAS has been in close partnership with PKU since 2009 to host the summer lectures on Constitutional Law by inviting international constitutional law experts from the European Union to given a series of a week-long lecture for PKU’s post graduates. Thus, one of its intent of publishing this Chinese volume is an outcome of the joint workshops carried out by KAS and PKU.

Moreover, the discourse and exchange of fundamental rights and civil liberties plays a critical role in world affairs particularly for the legal sector. However, language barriers hinder access to key articles and landmark decisions of another country’s highest court.

The translation stands at the intersections of legal theory, language theory and translation theory. Law and language share many similarities including the mutual concern with meaning and interpretation along with being knowledge systems and cultural resources. The Chinese language has unique characteristics when it comes to linguistic structure and writing form. It is also a strong medium of knowledge and part of the Chinese cultural treasury and great civilisation, representing a constant link between the past and the present.

Constitutional law in Germany and around the world operates within a growing global legal environment comprising of international law, international treaties, human rights law and judicial awareness seen in key constitutional court decisions around the world. The term “constitutionalism” is riven with ambiguity. Professor Gerhard Casper has stated, “it is neither clearly prescriptive nor clearly descriptive, its contours are difficult to discern. its historical roots are diverse and uncertain.” Since any effort to add more clarity on German constitutionalism would be an overreaching task, the term in this book will be limited to principles and ideas emerging from the country’s written constitution as interpreted by Germany’s highest court of constitutional review.

While previous constitutions in Germany were easily modified and not perceived as bindings in all areas, the Basic Law is binding in nature and controls the whole legal order. It is a well detailed and comprehensive document encompassing basic rights, federation, role of the various organs of state etc. Article 93 stipulates that the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) “shall rule on the interpretation of this Basic Law in the event of disputes.” The apex court has also held in one of its key cases that Germany’s laws “must also conform to unwritten fundamental constitutional principles as well as to the fundamental decisions of the Basic Law, in particular the principles of the rule of law and the social welfare state.” The committee of experts who drafted the Basic Law believed that the best way to achieve human dignity is by stipulating key principles of governance into the constitutional structure.

Germany’s constitutional law also represents a key departure from its past including upholding the free democratic order, revoking any article that undermines principles of rule of law, serenity, federalism and separation of powers and defining the special role of the court as a protector of constitutional order. The Bundesverfassungsgericht is a court that focuses exclusively on constitutional-related cases. The court’s cases are binding on all organs of state, all courts and public officials, underlining its role as the guardian of the Basic Law. The Basic Law empowers any person who claims his/her fundamental basic rights “has been violated by public authority” to lodge a case in the constitutional court.

We hope that the translated court cases will make way for increased engagement, interaction and exchange between legal experts in Asia and Europe. Translations of key documents are becoming increasingly important in our multicultural reality as part of knowledge sharing, transfer and learning mechanisms. It also allows courts and their administrations to interact with their counterparts in a more efficient and organised manner. Singapore’s lead as an international legal hub and dispute arbitration could also make way for a multilateral exchange between Chinese, German and Singaporean lawyers on constitutional issues. The city-state’s training of legal talent, series of regulatory and legal reforms and continuous effort to playing a leading role has brought its legal experts to the fore for greater interaction with their counterparts in the region and beyond. In the long run, the different stakeholders will benefit from this exchange in legal and academic aspects.

We are thankful to our partners who have assisted us with the book including our specialist translators, legal experts, partners etc. We thank Ms. Susan Chan, KAS Rule of Law Program Asia, for her long-time and remarkable support of the KAS-PKU cooperation. In addition, we are very grateful to Angle Publishing Co., Ltd. for their professional and exceptionally careful editing. Enormous efforts have been undertaken to translate every technical and complex aspect of the German constitution to ensure the highest level of accuracy, organisation and structure. Our team of experts, who have professional experience and specialised training in the area of constitutional law, have a deep and profound understanding of legal terminologies and concepts that are not just related to law but also pertaining to the area(s) where it is applied to. They have critically and meticulously studied the document to preserve the meaning in the text in its original context and produce equivalent meanings. They also have an understanding of the context and cultural nuances to help engage the Chinese-speaking reader. Mostly importantly they have ensured that the translation has done justice to the original document.
