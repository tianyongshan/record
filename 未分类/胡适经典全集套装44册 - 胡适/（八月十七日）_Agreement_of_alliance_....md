（八月十七日）

Agreement of alliance between the United Kingdom and Japan.

Preamble:

The government of Great Britain and the government of Japan, having in view the important changes which have taken place in the situation since the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese agreement of the 12th of August, 1905, and believing that a revision of that agreement responding to such changes would contribute to general stability and repose, have agreed upon the following stipulations to replace the agreement above mentioned, such stipulations having the same object as the said agreement, namely:

（a）The consolidation and maintenance of the general peace in the regions of Eastern Asia and India.

（b）The preservation of the common interests of all powers in China by insuring the independence and integrity of the Chinese empire and the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations in China.

（c）The maintenance of the territorial rights of the high contracting parties in the regions of Eastern Asia and India, and the defense of their special interests in the said regions.

Article I

It is agreed that whenever, in the opinion of either Great Britain or Japan, any of the rights and interests referred to in the preamble of this agreement are in jeopardy, the two governments will communicate with one another fully and frankly and will consider in common, the measures which should be taken to safeguard those menaced rights or interests.

Article Ⅱ

If by reason of unprovoked attack or aggressive action. whenever arising, on the part of any Power or Powers, either high contracting party should be involved in war in defense of its territorial rights or special interests mentioned in the preamble of this agreement, the other high contracting party will at once come to assistance of its ally and will conduct the war in common and make peace in mutual agreement with it.

Article Ⅲ

The high contracting parties agree that neither of them will, without consulting the other, enter into separate arrangements with another Power to the prejudice of the objects described in the preamble of this agreement.

Article IV

Should either high contracting party conclude a treaty of general arbitration with a third power, it is agreed that nothing in this agreement shall entail upon such contracting party an obligation to go to war with the power with whom such treaty of arbitration is in force.

Article V

The condition under which armed assistance shall be afforded by either power to the other in the circumstances mentioned in the present agreement and the means by which such assistance is to be made available will be arranged by the naval and military authorities of the high contracting parties, who will from time to time consult one another fully and freely upon all questions of mutual interest.

Article Ⅵ

The present agreement shall come into effect immediately after the date of its signature, and remain in force for ten years from that date.

In case neither of the high contracting parties should have notified twelve months before the expiration of the said ten years the intention of terminating it, it shall remain binding until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the high contracting parties shall have denounced it. But, if when the date fixed for its expiration arrives, either ally is actually engaged in war, the alliance shall ipso facto continue until peace is concluded.

Signed,

E. GREY,

Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

TAKAAKI KATO,

Ambassador Extraordinary.

日英盟约

（1911年7月13日签于伦敦）

前　言

大英帝国政府和日本政府鉴于自1905年8月12日日英盟约签订以来，形势已发生了重要的变化，认为为适应形势变化而对于上述盟约进行修改，将有助于促进地区安定与和平。因此达成协议签订如下条款以取代前述之盟约，此条款的宗旨与前述盟约一致，即：

（a）巩固和维持东亚与印度地区的和平。

（b）在确保中华帝国的独立与完整的前提下保护列强在华的共同利益，并坚持各国在华工业和贸易机会均等的原则。

（c）维护在东亚及印度等地区缔约各国的领土权利及保护在上述地区它们的特殊利益。

第一条

大英帝国及日本一致同意，当此盟约前言中所提及的任何权益受到威胁时，两国政府将彻底坦诚地交换意见，并考虑采取共同步骤以保护上述受到危害的权利和利益。

第二条

一旦发生了非因触犯而发生的攻击或侵略行为，就任何强国来说，缔约国一方为了保卫其领土的权利及在本盟约前言中所提及的特殊利益而卷入战争，则缔约另一方必须立即协助其盟国共同参战以达致盟约中所订之共同和平。

第三条

缔约双方均同意，任何一方在未与对方商定的情况下不得与任何强国单独达成协议以损害在本盟约前言中所提及之宗旨。

第四条

缔约任一方一旦与第三国达成仲裁协议，则此条约不应使此缔约国承担任何义务去与此仲裁条约对之生效的国家宣战。

第五条

此条约所提及的各种情况一旦发生，缔约一方应向另一方提供行之有效的军事援助，援助的条件及方式应由各缔约国的海军及军事当局来安排。各缔约国在此期间均应就关系到双方利益的问题不断进行磋商。

第六条

此条约自签字之日起立即生效，有效期为十年。

如果缔约双方在上述十年有效期满之前十二个月没有宣告废除此条约的意图，那么此条约将继续对缔约各方具有约束力，直至缔约各方宣告废除此条约之日起一年期满为止。又如果此指定的期满之日到来之际，有任一方仍处于交战状态之时，盟约仍继续生效直至达成和平之日为止。

日本特命大使 TAKAAKI KATO（签名）

以上是最新的经过修改的条文，目前已生效。

上载为日英盟约（一九一一年修正）之全稿。其第二条即所谓攻守同盟之约也。其第四条甚可玩味，所谓“仲裁”之约之功用，即此可见一斑。
