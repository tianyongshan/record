Book Eleven 卷十一

我给大众利益出过什么力吗

1.以下这些就是理性的灵魂的特质：它观察自己，分析自己，使自己成为自身所选的样子.自得其乐的果实——植物的果实以及那些依靠食用果实为生作乐的动物——它掌握着自身的灭亡，无论哪里是生命的上限。这不像在某个舞蹈或是某出戏中的那样，整个活动并不是完整的，如果有什么意外将其缩短的话.但是任何部分，以及无论其将在哪里停止，它都将使其在完善和完整之前变成预设好的那样，因此可以这么说，我拥有着我所拥有的。进一步，它横穿过整个宇宙，穿越周围的空间，测量着自己的构成，并将自己在无尽的时间内延伸，参透和领悟万物更新的周期，并体悟到那些在我们之后出现却并无新意的物体，或获得非我们目力所及的东西，但是对于某个四十岁的人来说，假如他有丝毫的理解之力，他已经看到了那些已存在的和将要出现的万物依靠一致性的美德，对邻里之爱，真实而谦虚，并不将一切看高于它自己，这也是法律的特质所在。因此，公正的命理从不因正义的名义而有所不同。

2.你也许并不看重悦耳的歌曲、优美的舞蹈或是激烈的竞技，如果你将声音的乐律分解成许多单音，且如果你的艺术为之主导并沉浸于其中。因为你将不会为自己的坦白感到尴尬，而且对于舞蹈而言，如果每一个动作和态度你都将保持一致。在竞技上也是这样。那么，对于世界万物，除却道德和道德的德行之外，你要牢记做到成为他们中的一部分，而且通过这样的分割，不会对他们过分珍视，同时将这条规则一以贯之于你的一生中。

3.对于灵魂，就是已经准备就绪的东西，如果每时每刻它都必须与躯体分离，并准备好不是消逝、解体，就是继续存在.但是对于这样的准备其实是取决于一个人自身的评判的，而不是来自单纯的固执，就像基督徒一样体贴地，以尊重体恤的方式去说服对方，而不是一场悲剧。

4.我给大众利益出过什么力吗？如果有的话，那我就已经得到了奖励。让我的脑海常有此念吧。永远不要停止行善。

5.你的职责是什么？多行善事。那么这将如何做到呢？除了遵从通法之外，一些是关于宇宙的本性，另外一些是人类的准确定律吗？

6.在最初，悲剧都是以提醒人们发生在自己身上的事情这种目的而搬上舞台的，而这也是依照自然所安排的事物发生，如果你对舞台上的演出感到满意的话，那么你就不会对在更大舞台上发生的故事有排斥。因为你知道这些事情终将了结，即使是他们喊出“哦，神啊”的惊叹声。而且，确实，一些事情在戏剧作者的笔下描述得很得人心，尤其是像以下这些：

假如神灵忽视我和我的孩子，这也同样是有其缘由的。再次——

我们不必对所发生的事情感到悲伤和苦恼。

生活之丰收正如饱满的麦穗一样。所有的都会如此。

悲剧之后，出现了古代喜剧，这对台词有着严格的自由度限制，而其质朴的语言能够成功地提醒人们注意骄傲自大的行为.而哲学家戴奥吉尼斯也正是出于此目的关注喜剧。

但是对于之后出现的中世纪喜剧来说，要探究其是什么，再一次，为此目的出现了新的喜剧，而其逐渐演变成为单纯的模仿表演了。这些作者说着同样的好人好事，也是那些众所周知的，但是整个诗歌和表演手法的设计，都是出于此目的！

7.这种形式是多么的平实清晰啊，生命中再没有别的什么形式能够如此对所发生的事有这般深刻的哲学意味。

8.把一节树枝从其毗邻的树枝边剪掉的同时，也就从整棵树上把它剪掉了。与此类似，一个人与另一个人相分离，其实也就是脱离了整个社会团体。就像树枝一样，另一节又被剪掉了，而一个人却是由于自己的行为从邻居中分离开的，尤其是当他痛恨自己并四处逃离时，而且与此同时，他并不自知他将自己同整个社会体系隔绝了。他也自然没有来自创建社会的宙斯的特权，因为你要依靠自己的力量重新成长以接近大众，并成为组成整体的一部分。但是，假如这事经常发生，经常出现此类分离的话，那么就会使得那些分离出的个体更加难以重返之前的团体了。最终，树枝会重新生根发芽同大树一起生长，继续着自己身上的生命历程，可是并不是被修剪然后又接枝，因为这就像园丁们所说的，树枝与树木一同生长，但是却有着不同的意味。

9.当你正朝着正确的方向启程时，对于那些想要阻挡你的前进道路之人，将无法使你从正确的道路上扭转回来，因此不要让他们利用你的仁慈之心去驱使你，而是你自己要权衡二者，这不仅仅是保持笃定的判断和行为，而且也是洞悉绅士对待那些想要阻碍你、找你麻烦的人。因为这也是一种缺点，对他们发火，而且从自己的道路上偏离方向，因害怕而让路。以下这两者都是成功终点的背叛者：那些因害怕而让道的人，以及与天生是同伴及朋友的人隔离的那些人。

10.没有哪种自然比艺术低下，因为艺术都是靠模仿自然获得的。但是如果事情是这样的话，自然是超越所有本质最为完美和最为全面的东西，那么它就不可能低于艺术的技巧。现在一切的艺术都为模仿上层而做出下层的东西，于是万能的自然也这么做。而且，此处确实是公正的起源，在公正面前，其他的美德也各有其基础：如果我们关注中层的东西（那些无关紧要的东西），或是很容易就被欺骗、粗心大意和变幻无常的话，那么就不可能发现公正。

11.如果这些事情不来主动找你，那么困扰着你的那些追求和回避将会仍然驱使你去找寻它们。让你对它们的评判暂告一段落吧，这样它们将重归平静，你也不必再继续追寻和逃避了。

12.当向各个目标延伸或是向内凹凸，或是分散或是下沉时，圆球形的灵魂仍然保持着它的形状，但却被光源照亮，因为它看到了真实，关于世界万物的真实以及自己的真实。

以最好的方式生活

13.试想所有的人都轻视我。让他自己只专注于自己的那种看法之中吧。但是我将看到这一点，我没有什么所作所为能够让人轻视我。所有的人都该恨我吗？让他自己想去吧。但是我将友好仁慈地对待每一个人，并随时准备好指出他的错误，但并不是以责备的口吻，也不是要展示我的忍耐，而是崇高地、诚恳地，就像伟大的Phocion那样，除非他要认为是如此。因为低下的东西就是这样，而神灵也应该不以任何不满和抱怨的情绪看待谁。因为如果你现在做的是出于天性，并且对此刻宇宙的自然所做的符合时宜的事感到满意的话，那么什么是你心中的恶魔？因为你是一个人类，是一个被安置在自己定位上的人类，在那个位置就是为了以某种方式实现共同的进步。

14.人们看不起一些人，却去讨好另一些人，而人们也希望在别人面前能够高人一等，同时却在另一些人面前卑躬屈膝。

15.他说的话是多么的伪善和不真诚啊，而我决定以公平的方式跟你交流。你正在干嘛，伙计？我不会对这个给予关注。行动将会不言自明。所说的话应该直截了当，让人一目了然。这就像人们的特征，能很快通过眼睛展现出来一样，就像那些处在恋爱中的人，能够从爱人眼中读出爱意一样。那些诚实、友善的人应该同时也是强壮的人，这样一来那些旁观者靠近他时，能够迅速觉察出他该选择此或彼。但是单纯质朴却是一根弯曲的棍棒。没什么比贪婪的友谊（虚假的友情）更可耻的东西了。规避它比规避任何邪恶都重要。友善、单纯和仁慈的人将在双眼中展示无疑，不会有任何出错的可能。

16.要想以最好的方式生活，那么这个力量是来自灵魂的，因为它才能决定对那些不足挂齿的事漠不关心。假如以脱离其他事物的方式看东西然后再整体视之，假如记住它并不是我们观念中的事物，或者也未靠近我们的话，它就不是重要的。但是这些东西仍然固定不变，而正是我们自己给它们作出评判。正如我们所说，正如我们所写，是否记载的权力在于我们。假如这些评判不知不觉地占据了我们的头脑的话，那是否将其擦除也取决于我们。如果我们还记住这些留意也只会存在很短的时间，而随之生命就将结束。况且，做这些所有的事情会带来什么麻烦呢？这些事都是依从自然，享乐其中，它们就将显而易见。假如它们不是顺其自然，而是追寻着你自己的安逸舒适，并且为之奋斗，那么它将不会带来任何荣誉，因为所有人都只会追求自我享乐。

17.思考每样事物从何而来，由什么组成，有什么变化，当其变化时又将会成为什么，并且依然没有损害吧。

18.如果谁冒犯了你，首先想想：我与他人有何联系，我们是依靠他人而生.从另一方面看来，我却高于他们之上，就像公羊统领羊群或是公牛超越兽群那样。但要从首要准则中考验事件。

首先：如果所有物体都不仅仅是原子，那么统治万物的是自然.如果事实是如此的话，下等的物体为烘托上等的而存在，这些物体的存在就是为了另一些物体。

其次，思考餐桌前的、床上的等等是怎样的一些人.尤其是，他们是被何种观念所束缚.对于他们的行为，想想他们是为什么荣誉而为。

第三，如果人类为正义而为，我们就不应当有什么不满，但如果他们做错了的话，显而易见，他们是出于非自愿或是无知所为之的。因为每个灵魂都是不情愿地被真实所剥夺，它同样也不情愿被人们自己的愿望所剥夺。于是，当人们被指责不公正、忘恩负义、贪得无厌，或总是对邻居不友善时，他们就会很痛苦。

第四，想想你自己也经常会做错事，你也就像其他人一样，即使你有时会尽量避开一些错误的发生，但是你还是难免处于冒犯他们的境况中。不是出于懦弱，就是出于对名誉的维护，再或者是一些自私的动机，你会因此避免一些错误。

第五，想想你也不总是明白人们什么时候做对什么时候做错，因为事情在不同情况下总是有不同的评判标准。简而言之，一个人必须要不断大量地学习以使自己能够评判他人的行为。

第六，在你自己恼怒或悲伤的时候，想想人的生命就是短短一瞬，不久之后我们都会死去。

第七，扰乱我们的并不是人们的行为，因为这些行为都是他们在基于人类规范准则的基础上作出的，但是在我们自己的观念中它们打扰了我们。排除这些观点，假如某些行为令你悲愤，那么就下决心丢弃你对行为的评判，你的气恼就会消失。那么我该如何丢弃这些观点呢？时刻在脑海中回映没有什么错误的行为会让我蒙羞，因为除非耻辱感本身是罪恶的，那你同样会做出许多错事，如成为一个抢劫犯或是别的什么。

第八，想想这些行为所引发的气愤和恼怒之情给我们带来了多少的痛苦，而我们对之是又气又恨。

第九，要知道一个好的脾性并不是不可练就的，如果这是确信无疑的话，那它就不是一个伪饰的笑容和行为。因为那只是暴躁的人会做的事，如果你继续善待他的话。假如情况允许，当他试图伤害你时，你将时时刻刻和缓地引导他并且纠正他的错误，并说：不要这样，我的孩子.我们被上苍所造，为的是追求别的东西.我当然不应该受到伤害，但是你正在伤害你自己，我的孩子。同时，你向他展示出机智、老练，而这也正是通用准则所指示的，即使是微小的蜜蜂也不会做他那样的事，其他任何自然创造出的群居生物也不会这么做。你不能以模棱两可的方式或是责备的方式去做，而是要深情感化、心中不含任何仇意.也不要以家长训诫般的方式教导他，更不要当着凑热闹的旁观者的面，而是即使有他人在场时，也要让他独处。

记住这九条规则，并且要像从宙斯那儿得到的礼物般珍视它，开始真正活得像个人。但是你同样也要避免对人的谄媚献好并屈居于他们之下，因为这两种做法都不是社会性的，而且会带来伤害。在你生气激动时想想这些真理吧，随随便便就会动怒的并不是男儿气概，而和善友好、温文尔雅之举，由于它们更贴近人类的本性，才是男子所为.那些拥有这些特质的人就拥有了力量、胆识和勇气，而那些意气用事、不满苛责的人却不是。这也等同于一个人的心胸越是不随事事起伏，就越是拥有力量。痛苦就是懦弱的表现，恼怒也一样。那些屈服于痛苦的人，和那些屈服于恼怒的人，两者都是残缺的和逆来顺受的。

但是，假如你还将受到来自众神的领袖（阿波罗）的第十个礼物，这就是——希望坏人所做错事不是出于疯狂，因为那些这么想的人简直就是在期盼不可能的事。要允许人们对其他人这么做，并期盼他们不要对你做什么错事，这是极不理智和残暴专制的。

19.有四种高等本领的犯规行为是有悖于你的自我防线的，一旦你察觉它们的存在，你应当立即将它们擦除并且对这些情形说：这个想法不是必要的.这个企图将摧毁社会联盟.你想脱口而出的话并不是出于真实想法.对你而言就该考虑一下最愚蠢的事就是一个人不说出他的真实想法。但是第四条是你对自己的所为进行责备，因为这是神性的证据，这个证据是：躯体被所有的享乐所征服并屈从了它。

20.虽然在自然中是上升之力，但是在你体内混合的水性及火性仍然遵从宇宙的旨意，它们在此组成了质量（躯体）。同样在你体内的所有土质和水质部分，虽然它们是下沉之力，但它们仍然在提升并且在非它们自身的自然特性中占有一席之地。在这种方式下，基本的部分都遵从着宇宙的规则，因为当它们在某地固定不变时，它们会一直停留在那儿，直到宇宙再次发出解散的讯号。这是否意味着你的才智就该对自己所属的位置感到不满并且要挣脱反抗却并不感到稀奇呢？而且没有外力强迫它如此，仅仅是那些东西要顺从自身的天性：它仍然不屈从，而是以相反的方向发展。对于那些非正义、无节制、愤怒、悲伤和害怕的举动，无疑都是脱离了天性轨道的表现。而且当规则对所发生之事感到不满时，当然也会废弃自己的位置，因为它是出于对神灵而不是公正的虔诚和敬畏。在常规意义上满意于事物构成的情况下，人们认识了这些特质，而它们也确实凌驾于公正之上。

21.对于那些在生命中不总是只有单一的或是相同目标的人来说，不可能成为一个特定的人或是保持同样的生存状态。但是我所说的还远不止这些，除非把这点加上，那就是这个目标该是什么。因为由于对万物并没有相同的看法，或是有些被大众认为是好的，且仅限于某些特定的事物，即那些与共同利益息息相关的事物.所以我们同样应该给自己提出另一个目标，而这个目标当是大众的（社会的）和政治的。因为对于为这个目标不断奋斗的人而言，将会有着类似的举动，并且常常会有相同的行为。

22.想想乡下的老鼠和镇上的老鼠吧，想想镇上老鼠对于警笛声的恐惧。

23.苏格拉底常常用女妖和怪物的名字来称呼各种观念，来吓唬小孩子。

24.古斯巴达人在他们的公共看台上设出外来人的专席，而自己却随处就坐。

25.苏格拉底给自己没去波底卡斯那儿找理由，说，这是因为我不打算在最坏的结果中腐朽，也就是说，我没有受到青睐，于是别人也无力回敬我。

26.在以弗所书中有这样一条戒律，即：常常想想那些上次施行了美德的人。

27.毕达哥拉斯教诲我们清晨时看看苍穹，我们也许能回想起那些一直不停地做同样事情并且一如既往地做着自己工作的人，同样也能回想起他们的纯净和简单。因为星宿里没有恶魔。

28.想想当苏格拉底为凡身时是个怎样的人，在涅西比拿走他的斗篷并离开后，苏格拉底对那些为他感到羞耻并远离他的朋友们说了什么。

29.在你首先学会自己遵守规则之前，无论是书写还是阅读都不会使你能够为他人设定规则。在生活中这样的例子屡见不鲜。

30.如果你是一个奴隶，那么自由言论的权力就不属于你。

31.而且我的内心在大笑。

32.他们诅咒，用严厉的言语。

33.在冬日寻找无花果是疯子的行径，这就好比有个人要在不被允许时找寻自己的孩子。

34.“当一个人亲吻他的孩子时，”爱彼克泰德说，他应当对自己耳语，“明天恐怕你就将死去”。但这些话是不好的预兆。“没什么话是不好的预兆，”埃彼克泰德说，“都是表达自然的话。或者如果是这样的话，那么连说麦穗熟了也会是不好的预兆。”

35.未熟的葡萄、熟了的葡萄、枯死的葡萄，所有这些都是变化，并不是空无一物，而是一些尚未存在的东西罢了。

36.没人能够夺去我们自由的意愿。

37.埃彼克泰德也说过，一个人必须寻找一个给予自己赞成之意的艺术之道（或是规则）.对于自己的举动，他必须小心谨慎地处理当时的环境，他们必须符合社会利益，必须符合目标的价值.对于肉体上的欲望，他应该将之抵挡门外.对于回避的事（厌恶的人），他应该不要对任何不在我们掌控之中的事展示出自己的厌恶之情。

38.这个争论，他说，不是什么关于普遍事物的，而是关于疯狂与否的。

39.苏格拉底常说，你想要什么，理性的心灵还是不理性的？理性的。怎样的理性，健全或不健全？健全的。那你为什么不去追求呢？因为我们拥有它。那为什么你们还打斗和争吵？

1.These are the properties of the rational soul： it sees itself， analyses itself， and makes itself such as it chooses. the fruit which it bears itself enjoys- for the fruits of plants and that in animals which corresponds to fruits others enjoy- it obtains its own end， wherever the limit of life may be fixed. Not as in a dance and in a play and in such like things， where the whole action is incomplete， if anything cuts it short. but in every part and wherever it may be stopped， it makes what has been set before it full and complete， so that it can say， I have what is my own. And further it traverses the whole universe， and the surrounding vacuum， and surveys its form， and it extends itself into the infinity of time， and embraces and comprehends the periodical renovation of all things， and it comprehends that those who come after us will see nothing new， nor have those before us seen anything more， but in a manner he who is forty years old， if he has any understanding at all， has seen by virtue of the uniformity that prevails all things which have been and all that will be. This too is a property of the rational soul， love of one's neighbour， and truth and modesty， and to value nothing more more than itself， which is also the property of Law. Thus then right reason differs not at all from the reason of justice.

2.Thou wilt set little value on pleasing song and dancing and the pancratium， if thou wilt distribute the melody of the voice into its several sounds， and ask thyself as to each， if thou art mastered by this. for thou wilt be prevented by shame from confessing it： and in the matter of dancing， if at each movement and attitude thou wilt do the same. and the like also in the matter of the pancratium. In all things， then， except virtue and the acts of virtue， remember to apply thyself to their several parts， and by this division to come to value them little： and apply this rule also to thy whole life.

3.What a soul that is which is ready， if at any moment it must be separated from the body， and ready either to be extinguished or dispersed or continue to exist. but so that this readiness comes from a man's own judgement， not from mere obstinacy， as with the Christians， but considerately and with dignity and in a way to persuade another， without tragic show.

4.Have I done something for the general interest？ Well then I have had my reward. Let this always be present to thy mind， and never stop doing such good.

5.What is thy art？ To be good. And how is this accomplished well except by general principles， some about the nature of the universe， and others about the proper constitution of man？

6.At first tragedies were brought on the stage as means of reminding men of the things which happen to them， and that it is according to nature for things to happen so， and that， if you are delighted with what is shown on the stage， you should not be troubled with that which takes place on the larger stage. For you see that these things must be accomplished thus， and that even they bear them who cry out "O Cithaeron." And， indeed， some things are said well by the dramatic writers， of which kind is the following especially：

Me and my children if the gods neglect，

This has its reason too. And again-

We must not chale and fret at that which happens. And Life's harvest reap like the wheat's fruitful ear. And other things of the same kind.

After tragedy the old comedy was introduced， which had a magisterial freedom of speech， and by its very plainness of speaking was useful in reminding men to beware of insolence. and for this purpose too Diogenes used to take from these writers.

But as to the middle comedy which came next， observe what it was， and again， for what object the new comedy was introduced， which gradually sunk down into a mere mimic artifice. That some good things are said even by these writers， everybody knows： but the whole plan of such poetry and dramaturgy， to what end does it look！

7.How plain does it appear that there is not another condition of life so well suited for philosophising as this in which thou now happenest to be.

8.A branch cut off from the adjacent branch must of necessity be cut off from the whole tree also. So too a man when he is separated from another man has fallen off from the whole social community. Now as to a branch， another cuts it off， but a man by his own act separates himself from his neighbour when he hates him and turns away from him， and he does not know that he has at the same time cut himself off from the whole social system. Yet he has this privilege certainly from Zeus who framed society， for it is in our power to grow again to that which is near to us， and be to come a part which helps to make up the whole. However， if it often happens， this kind of separation， it makes it difficult for that which detaches itself to be brought to unity and to be restored to its former condition. Finally， the branch， which from the first grew together with the tree， and has continued to have one life with it， is not like that which after being cut off is then ingrafted， for this is something like what the gardeners mean when they say that it grows with the rest of the tree， but that it has not the same mind with it.

9.As those who try to stand in thy way when thou art proceeding according to right reason， will not be able to turn thee aside from thy proper action， so neither let them drive thee from thy benevolent feelings towards them， but be on thy guard equally in both matters， not only in the matter of steady judgement and action， but also in the matter of gentleness towards those who try to hinder or otherwise trouble thee. For this also is a weakness， to be vexed at them， as well as to be diverted from thy course of action and to give way through fear. for both are equally deserters from their post， the man who does it through fear， and the man who is alienated from him who is by nature a kinsman and a friend.

10.There is no nature which is inferior to art， for the arts imitate the nature of things. But if this is so， that nature which is the most perfect and the most comprehensive of all natures， cannot fall short of the skill of art. Now all arts do the inferior things for the sake of the superior. therefore the universal nature does so too. And， indeed， hence is the origin of justice， and in justice the other virtues have their foundation： for justice will not be observed， if we either care for middle things （things indifferent）， or are easily deceived and careless and changeable.

11.If the things do not come to thee， the pursuits and avoidances of which disturb thee， still in a manner thou goest to them. Let then thy judgement about them be at rest， and they will remain quiet， and thou wilt not be seen either pursuing or avoiding.

12.The spherical form of the soul maintains its figure， when it is neither extended towards any object， nor contracted inwards， nor dispersed nor sinks down， but is illuminated by light， by which it sees the truth， the truth of all things and the truth that is in itself.

13.Suppose any man shall despise me. Let him look to that himself. But I will look to this， that I be not discovered doing or saying anything deserving of contempt. Shall any man hate me？ Let him look to it. But I will be mild and benevolent towards every man， and ready to show even him his mistake， not reproachfully， nor yet as making a display of my endurance， but nobly and honestly， like the great Phocion， unless indeed he only assumed it. For the interior parts ought to be such， and a man ought to be seen by the gods neither dissatisfied with anything nor complaining. For what evil is it to thee， if thou art now doing what is agreeable to thy own nature， and art satisfied with that which at this moment is suitable to the nature of the universe， since thou art a human being placed at thy post in order that what is for the common advantage may be done in some way？

14.Men despise one another and flatter one another. and men wish to raise themselves above one another， and crouch before one another.

15.How unsound and insincere is he who says， I have determined to deal with thee in a fair way.- What art thou doing， man？ There is no occasion to give this notice. It will soon show itself by acts. The voice ought to be plainly written on the forehead. Such as a man's character is， he immediately shows it in his eyes， just as he who is beloved forthwith reads everything in the eyes of lovers. The man who is honest and good ought to be exactly like a man who smells strong， so that the bystander as soon as he comes near him must smell whether he choose or not. But the affectation of simplicity is like a crooked stick. Nothing is more disgraceful than a wolfish friendship （false friendship）. Avoid this most of all. The good and simple and benevolent show all these things in the eyes， and there is no mistaking.

16.As to living in the best way， this power is in the soul， if it be indifferent to things which are indifferent. And it will be indifferent， if it looks on each of these things separately and all together， and if it remembers that not one of them produces in us an opinion about itself， nor comes to us. but these things remain immovable， and it is we ourselves who produce the judgements about them， and， as we may say， write them in ourselves， it being in our power not to write them， and it being in our power， if perchance these judgements have imperceptibly got admission to our minds， to wipe them out. and if we remember also that such attention will only be for a short time， and then life will be at an end. Besides， what trouble is there at all in doing this？ For if these things are according to nature， rejoice in them， and they will be easy to thee： but if contrary to nature， seek what is conformable to thy own nature， and strive towards this， even if it bring no reputation. for every man is allowed to seek his own good.

17.Consider whence each thing is come， and of what it consists， and into what it changes， and what kind of a thing it will be when it has changed， and that it will sustain no harm.

18.If any have offended against thee， consider first： What is my relation to men， and that we are made for one another. and in another respect， I was made to be set over them， as a ram over the flock or a bull over the herd. But examine the matter from first principles， from this： If all things are not mere atoms， it is nature which orders all things： if this is so， the inferior things exist for the sake of the superior， and these for the sake of one another.

Second， consider what kind of men they are at table， in bed， and so forth： and particularly， under what compulsions in respect of opinions they are. and as to their acts， consider with what pride they do what they do.

Third， that if men do rightly what they do， we ought not to be displeased. but if they do not right， it is plain that they do so involuntarily and in ignorance. For as every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth， so also is it unwillingly deprived of the power of behaving to each man according to his deserts. Accordingly men are pained when they are called unjust， ungrateful， and greedy， and in a word wrong-doers to their neighbours.

Fourth， consider that thou also doest many things wrong， and that thou art a man like others. and even if thou dost abstain from certain faults， still thou hast the disposition to commit them， though either through cowardice， or concern about reputation， or some such mean motive， thou dost abstain from such faults.

Fifth， consider that thou dost not even understand whether men are doing wrong or not， for many things are done with a certain reference to circumstances. And in short， a man must learn a great deal to enable him to pass a correct judgement on another man's acts.

Sixth， consider when thou art much vexed or grieved， that man's life is only a moment， and after a short time we are all laid out dead.

Seventh， that it is not men's acts which disturb us， for those acts have their foundation in men's ruling principles， but it is our own opinions which disturb us. Take away these opinions then， and resolve to dismiss thy judgement about an act as if it were something grievous， and thy anger is gone. How then shall I take away these opinions？ By reflecting that no wrongful act of another brings shame on thee： for unless that which is shameful is alone bad， thou also must of necessity do many things wrong， and become a robber and everything else.

Eighth， consider how much more pain is brought on us by the anger and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves， at which we are angry and vexed.

Ninth， consider that a good disposition is invincible， if it be genuine， and not an affected smile and acting a part. For what will the most violent man do to thee， if thou continuest to be of a kind disposition towards him， and if， as opportunity offers， thou gently admonishest him and calmly correctest his errors at the very time when he is trying to do thee harm， saying， Not so， my child： we are constituted by nature for something else： I shall certainly not be injured， but thou art injuring thyself， my child.- And show him with gentle tact and by general principles that this is so， and that even bees do not do as he does， nor any animals which are formed by nature to be gregarious. And thou must do this neither with any double meaning nor in the way of reproach， but affectionately and without any rancour in thy soul. and not as if thou wert lecturing him， nor yet that any bystander may admire， but either when he is alone， and if others are present...

Remember these nine rules， as if thou hadst received them as a gift from the Muses， and begin at last to be a man while thou livest. But thou must equally avoid flattering men and being veied at them， for both are unsocial and lead to harm. And let this truth be present to thee in the excitement of anger， that to be moved by passion is not manly， but that mildness and gentleness， as they are more agreeable to human nature， so also are they more manly. and he who possesses these qualities possesses strength， nerves and courage， and not the man who is subject to fits of passion and discontent. For in the same degree in which a man's mind is nearer to freedom from all passion， in the same degree also is it nearer to strength： and as the sense of pain is a characteristic of weakness， so also is anger. For he who yields to pain and he who yields to anger， both are wounded and both submit.

But if thou wilt， receive also a tenth present from the leader of the Muses （Apollo）， and it is this- that to expect bad men not to do wrong is madness， for he who expects this desires an impossibility. But to allow men to behave so to others， and to expect them not to do thee any wrong， is irrational and tyrannical.

19.There are four principal aberrations of the superior faculty against which thou shouldst be constantly on thy guard， and when thou hast detected them， thou shouldst wipe them out and say on each occasion thus： this thought is not necessary： this tends to destroy social union： this which thou art going to say comes not from the real thoughts. for thou shouldst consider it among the most absurd of things for a man not to speak from his real thoughts. But the fourth is when thou shalt reproach thyself for anything， for this is an evidence of the diviner part within thee being overpowered and yielding to the less honourable and to the perishable part， the body， and to its gross pleasures.

20.Thy aerial part and all the fiery parts which are mingled in thee， though by nature they have an upward tendency， still in obedience to the disposition of the universe they are overpowered here in the compound mass （the body）. And also the whole of the earthy part in thee and the watery， though their tendency is downward， still are raised up and occupy a position which is not their natural one. In this manner then the elemental parts obey the universal， for when they have been fixed in any place perforce they remain there until again the universal shall sound the signal for dissolution. Is it not then strange that thy intelligent part only should be disobedient and discontented with its own place？ And yet no force is imposed on it， but only those things which are conformable to its nature： still it does not submit， but is carried in the opposite direction. For the movement towards injustice and intemperance and to anger and grief and fear is nothing else than the act of one who deviates from nature. And also when the ruling faculty is discontented with anything that happens， then too it deserts its post： for it is constituted for piety and reverence towards the gods no less than for justice. For these qualities also are comprehended under the generic term of contentment with the constitution of things， and indeed they are prior to acts of justice.

21.He who has not one and always the same object in life， cannot be one and the same all through his life. But what I have said is not enough， unless this also is added， what this object ought to be. For as there is not the same opinion about all the things which in some way or other are considered by the majority to be good， but only about some certain things， that is， things which concern the common interest. so also ought we to propose to ourselves an object which shall be of a common kind （social） and political. For he who directs all his own efforts to this object， will make all his acts alike， and thus will always be the same.

26.In the writings of the Ephesians there was this precept， constantly to think of some one of the men of former times who practised virtue.

27.The Pythagoreans bid us in the morning look to the heavens that we may be reminded of those bodies which continually do the same things and in the same manner perform their work， and also be reminded of their purity and nudity. For there is no veil over a star.

28.Consider what a man Socrates was when he dressed himself in a skin， after Xanthippe had taken his cloak and gone out， and what Socrates said to his friends who were ashamed of him and drew back from him when they saw him dressed thus.

29.Neither in writing nor in reading wilt thou be able to lay down rules for others before thou shalt have first learned to obey rules thyself. Much more is this so in life.

30.A slave thou art： free speech is not for thee.

31.And my heart laughed within.

32.And virtue they will curse， speaking harsh words.

33.To look for the fig in winter is a madman's act： such is he who looks for his child when it is no longer allowed.

34.When a man kisses his child， said Epictetus， he should whisper to himself， "To-morrow perchance thou wilt die."- But those are words of bad omen.- "No word is a word of bad omen，" said Epictetus， "which expresses any work of nature. or if it is so， it is also a word of bad omen to speak of the ears of corn being reaped."

37.Epictetus also said， A man must discover an art （or rules） with respect to giving his assent. and in respect to his movements he must be careful that they be made with regard to circumstances， that they be consistent with social interests， that they have regard to the value of the object. and as to sensual desire， he should altogether keep away from it. and as to avoidance （aversion） he should not show it with respect to any of the things which are not in our power.

38.The dispute then， he said， is not about any common matter， but about being mad or not.

39.Socrates used to say， What do you want？ Souls of rational men or irrational？- Souls of rational men.- Of what rational men？ Sound or unsound？- Sound.- Why then do you not seek for them？- Because we have them.- Why then do you fight and quarrel？
