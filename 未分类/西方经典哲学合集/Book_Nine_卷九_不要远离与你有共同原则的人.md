Book Nine 卷九

不要远离与你有共同原则的人

1.做事不公正的人就是对神灵的不敬。因为大自然是为了让理性生物互相依存才创造了它们，她是要让理性的生物们互帮互助，而绝不是以任何形式伤害彼此。违背大自然意愿的人理所当然是有罪的，因为他对最高神灵大不敬。

而撒谎的人也同样因触犯了神灵而犯下罪孽.因为大自然的本性就是万物的本性.与万物相关联的事物才有诞生存在的理由。进而，这种宇宙的本性被人类奉为真理，它就是真实的万物的因。有意说谎的人因其不公正的行骗行为而犯下对神灵不敬之罪.而非有意说谎的人同样也违背了大自然的意愿，因其对抗自然而扰乱了大自然的秩序.因为其对抗自然，他也就走向了真理的相反面，因为他此时还不具有辨别是非的能力而只是从自然的消极面汲取了消极的力量。

而那些将享乐当作神一样来追逐，把痛苦当作魔鬼一样来躲避的人，同样也是对神灵不敬的，他们是有罪的。因为这样的人必然总是会抱怨大自然，声称她没有公平地把万物分配给善人和恶人，因为恶人总是能纵情声色，拥有能产生快乐的东西，而好人分到的只有痛苦以及为他们带来痛苦的东西。进而，害怕痛苦的人有时候也会害怕世界上可能会发生的事，而这也算是一种对神灵的不敬。追求享乐的人不会戒除不公的作风，这显然也是一种不敬。

现在，关于那些受到大自然相同影响的事物——因为除非大自然对它们的影响是完全相同的，否则她不会创造出它们来——想要追随大自然的人应该以相同的心态来看待它们。关于痛苦和快乐，生与死，或是荣与辱，它们都是大自然创造出的产物，没有一一经历过这些的人显然也是对神灵不敬的。我想要说的是，大自然均等地使用它们，我并不是说它们同样地发生在一代一代的人身上，也不是说它们同样地发生在那些因神灵的本意而产生的后来人身上，再根据这样的天意，它们从某一点开始重蹈覆辙，然后想到它们未来的某种法则，这决定了一种能够产生存在和变迁的力量以及相类似的连续不断的力量。

2.倘若一个人一生中都没有尝试说谎、虚伪、奢侈、自负，然后离开人间，这真是人最好的命运了。然而就像俗话所说的那样，当一个人对以上这些有所尝试时再结束自己的生命，这就无异于一场仅次于最好的旅行了。你是否已决心向恶，却尚未劝服自己逃离这场瘟疫？因为理性的丧失也是一场瘟疫，比我们周围的气候的腐化或是改变更像是一场瘟疫。因为气候的腐化之于动物是动物的一场瘟疫，而理性的腐化之于人类是人类的一场瘟疫。

3.不要鄙视死亡，而是要因死亡而感到圆满，因为这也是大自然的意愿之一。因为就像人总是会经历青春和衰老，日臻成熟，长出牙齿和胡须还有白发，怀孕还有生育，然后抚养成人，还有其他所有的生命四季的自然造化。死亡也是这样的事。而这与一个反省之人的性格也是一致的，对于死亡的态度既不粗心大意，也不缺乏耐心，也不会鄙视，而是要将死亡当作大自然里一个平常的必经过程来静静地等候。就像你现在正等待着宝宝从妻子的子宫中分娩出一样，因此你也要做好准备迎接灵魂离开你的躯体的那个时刻。但是如果你也要求能得到一种直抵你心灵的庸俗的宽慰，那你将通过仔细观察那些你就要离开的事物，还有那些灵魂不再与之交往的人们的品行来与死亡和解。因为，由于受到他人的冒犯而恼怒是不当的行为，而尊重他们、温柔地包涵他们才是你应该要做的事。还要记住的是，不要远离那些与你拥有相同原则的人。因为如果世上真有可以向相反的方向引领我们并让我们依赖生命的事的话，那么和那些与自己拥有相同原则的人生活在一起便是唯一可做的事了。但是现在你可以看到住在一起的人因彼此不和会产生多大的麻烦，这样，你可能就会说，哦，死神啊，快来吧，恐怕连我都要迷失自己了。

4.人们做错事，最终究竟还是害了自己。而行为不端的人最终也究竟是害了自己，因为他让自己变成了恶人。

5.不仅仅是那些做了某事的人是行为不端的人，而那些没有做某事的人其实也是行为不端之人。

6.现在你的看法观点建立在理解之上，你的行为也是为了社会的利益，而你对发生的一切都感到满足——这样就足够了。

7.不要再幻想，克制欲望，消除贪欲，充分发挥自己的才能吧。

8.没有理性的生物拥有的只有生命，而理性生物却拥有睿智的灵魂。万物共享一片热土，都禀赋着大自然的灵气，而我们看到的是同一种光线，呼吸的是同样的空气，我们所有的人都拥有着视觉的官能，也都拥有着生命。

9.共同承担的事物都会偏向于它们的同类。由土而生的事物总还是会回归大地，一切液态的存在体都将不断流动，最终交汇到一起，而所有气态的事物也同样如此，因此它们就需要某个事物或是借助某种力量来将它们分离开。确实是这样啊，火是由于其猛烈的火焰才向上燃烧，但这火是如此情愿与此处的火一起燃烧，就连一切干燥的、易燃的物体都会一同燃烧。这是因为这些物体中很少混杂不易燃烧的物质。因此，所有分享着相同理性的事物也以相似的方式偏向于自己的同类，甚至会偏向得更为明显。因为较之一切其他的事物，它显得要高等得多，它也同样更为情愿和与它相似的事物混合或融合进彼此中。于是我们在非理性的生物中发现了成群的蜜蜂、牛羊，我们还发现了成鸟哺育雏鸟以及表现出来的爱.因为即使是动物，它们同样拥有灵魂，而将它们聚集到一处的力量似乎也在很大程度上充分发挥出来了。而在植物、岩石还有树木中，我们却从没有观察到这样的现象。然而当我们观察理性生物时，却看到了政治集团、友谊、家庭以及人们的集会，此外我们也看到了战争、协商以及休战。但是在那些更为高等的生物中，即使它们彼此分离，也还是以某种方式统一在一起，就如夜空中的星斗一样。这也就是说，上升到更高等的境界，即便彼此分离，也能产生一种互相之间的彼此扶持。那么，看吧，现在发生了什么？因为现在只有理性生物遗忘了彼此的欲望和癖好，也只有在它们那里我们看不到聚集到一起的趋势。不过尽管人们竭力避免这样的聚集，他们仍然会因此而受到牵绊，因为他们的本性过于强烈.只要你稍稍观察一下，就能领悟我的这番话。那么你就将发现任何生于土的事物与非生于土的事物产生联系都要比一个人脱离人群的速度快得多。

10.无论是神，是人还是天地，都能开花结果.它们在合适的季节中结出果实。但是，如果把这些词语用于藤蔓或是与之类似的事物却没有任何意义。理性存在体的开花结果，既是为了众生，也是为了自身，它们产生了与理性本身性质相同的另一些事物。

别让他人的恶行影响你

11.倘若你力所能及，那就去教导那些做了错事的人吧，但是倘若你有心无力，那就记住宽容就是因此而生的。而神灵同样也会宽恕这些人的，它甚至会出于某些缘故来帮助他们获得健康、财富和声誉。神灵对众生是如此仁爱。而你同样有能力做到，或者说，谁能阻止你做到呢？

12.不要神情沮丧地劳作，也不要像一个被同情或是被称赞的人那样地劳作，而是要将你的意愿专注于某一件事，付诸行动，不断反省自身，就如社会理性所要求的那样。

13.如今，我已经摆脱了所有的烦恼，或者说我已经丢掉了所有的烦恼，因为烦恼并不来自于外界，而是来自于内心，在我的个人主张中。

14.万物都是一样的，都拥有丰富的经验，而存在的时间也都是短暂的，但其价值都是不可估量的。如今的万物都与我们埋葬了的那些历史里曾经存在过的事物是一样的。

15.事物外在于我们，它们都不了解自身，也不能发表任何的判断。那如何评价它们呢？依靠你的理性。

16.理性的社会生物的善与恶并不在于被动的所作所为，而是其主动的所作所为，正如他的美德和罪恶也不在于其被动的所作所为，而是主动的所作所为一样。

17.对于一枚被掷向天空的石头而言，掉下来并不是什么罪恶，而被人携带也绝不是什么好事。

18.深入了解人们的行事原则，你就会发现你所害怕的是怎样的评价，你也能发现人们对自身的评价又是怎样的。

19.万物都在改变：你自身就是在不断的转变中，某种意义上来说，你自身也处于不断的毁灭之中，而整个宇宙也正是这样。

20.你不应让他人的恶行影响你。

21.运动的终止，观点的停摆，以至于死亡，从某种意义上来说都不是罪恶。现在就转变你的思维，思考思考你的生命，生命就像是一个孩童，或是青年、壮年还有老年，因为在这些阶段里，每一次的改变都是死亡，这有什么好害怕的呢？现在就转变你的思维，想一想你祖父的人生，接着是你母亲的人生，然后是你父亲的人生。而当你发现了更多别的不同还有改变或者终止，那就问问你自己，这有什么好害怕的吗？然后再以这样的方式类推到这样的结论无论是生命的终止或是改变，都不是可害怕的事情。

22.赶紧省察自己的理性（Ruling Factlty），天地的理性以及邻居的理性吧：省察你自己的理性，你可以让它更为公道省察天地的理性，你要记住的是，你是它的一部分.省察邻里的理性，你可以由此得知他是行事莽撞还是充满睿智，而你也可以发现他的理性是否能与你的理性相媲美。

23.因为你是社会大系统里的一个组成部分，所以，就要让你的每一个行为也契合社会生活。你的任何行为如若与社会利益没有直接或是间接的联系，那无论是什么行为，都会毁坏你的生活。不要让行为整齐划一，人类有叛逆的天性，就好像某人在公众集会上我行我素，不苟同于人们普遍的看法一样。

24.小孩子的吵闹，他们的游戏，还有躯体已然灭亡的可悲的灵魂，这就是一切。亡者的住宅中的陈列品更强烈地冲击着我们的视觉。

25.观察对象形式上的特征，将对象与其物理成分分开来，接着再注视对象，然后确定其时间，这就是这种形式的物体所能自然忍耐的最长的时间了。

26.你已经经历了无数的烦恼，因为你不满于自己的理性，而你的理性只是做了命里注定的事。但是，这已足够了。

27.倘若有人责备你或者厌恶你，倘若有人说了中伤你的话，那么你就接近了他们可悲的灵魂，探究他们，看看他们究竟是什么样的人。你将发现其实完全没有理由因为他们而让自己烦恼，因为这些人总是对你有着这样或者那样的看法。无论怎样，你都一定要善待他们，因为他们的本性是友好的。而众神灵也会借助各种各样的手段帮助他们，比如托梦给他们，或者暗示他们，以此让他们得到他们所珍惜的事物。

28.宇宙的周期性活动也同样如此，年复一年起起伏伏。而人类的理性也在活动，这也就引起了各种各样的结果.如果理性尚且如此，那就满足于理性运动的结果吧.或者宇宙理性一旦活动，万物就以某种方式跟随着一起运动.又或者万物其实都来自于不可分割的元素。总而言之，倘若有神灵的庇佑，那一切都会进展顺利.倘若是偶然因素决定一切，那就不要被它完全支配。

不久之后，大地就要淹没我们所有人.到那时，大地也会改变，而由这变化而产生的所有事物也都会继续改变，直到永远，不断地循环反复。因为如果有人仔细思虑这些变化以及如同波浪般一浪接着一浪的不间断的转变，他就将鄙夷一切易腐烂的事物了。

29.万物的因就像是冬日里的激流：它裹挟走一切。然而所有这些卷入政治漩涡，还在装腔作势高谈阔论哲学的可怜的人们是多么的一无是处。他们都是喋喋不休的傻瓜。好吧，你，就去做天性要求你做的事去吧。开始行动，如果你可以做得到，不要再东张西望想要看看是否有人观望着你.不要指望柏拉图的理想国了，而是要懂得满足，如果连最细小的事也做得很好。不要把这样的事当成是小事。因为有谁能改变人们的看法呢？而不能改变别人的观点，也就只能做个表面不吭一声，暗地里却哀声连连的奴隶了。那就过来，给我讲讲亚历山大大帝、菲利普还有法拉鲁姆的德莫特雷斯（Demetrius）的故事吧。他们自己也会判断自己是否了解了共同天性的要求，也按照要求训练自己。然而如果他们表现得像个悲剧英雄，那就不会有人责备我模仿他们。哲人就应当朴实而谦逊。不要将我引向懒惰与自负的深渊。

30.俯瞰熙熙攘攘的人群和他们各种各样数不尽的庄重仪式，还有在或平静或狂暴的海面的数不尽的航行，再看看生活在一起的众生的差别，看着他们生或死。也不妨想一想古时的人们、你的后来人，那些生活在荒蛮民族的人们，想想他们的生命，想想他们中有多少人连你的名字都不知晓，有多少人不久就要忘掉你的姓名，而他们也许现在还在赞许你，不久就要责备你，人死后，他的姓名就不再有任何价值，无论是声誉还是其他都是这样的。

31.快摆脱因外界的干扰而产生的焦虑吧，公正地对待内在因素产生的各种各样的事吧，也就是你要从事的社会性活动，因为这么做符合你的天性。

32.你可以清除掉许多扰乱你的无用的东西，因为这些东西完全在于你的看法.而你倘若想为自己赢得一个更广阔的空间，那就是要用心思考整个宇宙，思虑时间的永恒，并观察每个瞬息万变的事物，从生到死是多么短暂，而生之前、死之后的时间又是如此无限。

不要和愚昧的人作无意义的谈话

33.你所看到的所有事物都将很快消逝，而那些目睹过死亡的人们也将很快消逝。那些活得最长久的人和那些过早离世的人最终都是要被死神带走，二者没有什么差别。

34.这些人的主要原则是什么呢？他们在忙碌些什么呢？他们因为什么样的理由热爱和尊敬呢？想象一下他们那贫瘠的可悲的灵魂。他们认为自己理应因受罚而行恶，因称赞而行善，这是多么荒谬的想法啊！

35.损失只是一种改变。而大自然因改变而快乐，臣服于她的万物如今都进行顺利，自古便是以类似的形式进行，而且永远都会是这样。那么你还想要说什么呢？要说万物业已或总归要变坏的吗？还是要说至今都没有发现神灵有矫正这一切的力量，而这个世界充斥在永不停歇的罪恶中呢？

36.万物之基的物质的腐烂啊！水，尘埃，骷髅，污物.或是大理石，大地的硬化.金银，沉淀的物质.衣服，一点毛皮.紫色的染料，鲜血.所有其他的一切，也是相同种类的事物罢了。具有呼吸天性的事物也是相同种类的另一事物，只不过从此变化到彼。

37.这种悲惨的生活，嘀嘀咕咕和愚蠢的伎俩，够了。你为什么苦恼呢？这有什么新奇的呢？是什么扰乱了你呢？这是事物的表面吗？看看它吧。还是事物的本质呢？看看它。但是除此以外已别无他物了。那就面向神灵，此时总算变得更简单、更好了。无论我们是花了百年还是三年来观察这些事物，得出的结论都是一样的。

38.如果有人做了错事，那只是对他自己有害。但是，也许他并没有做错。

39.也许万物都有一个相同的理性根源，在一个群体中统一为整体，每一个成分为了整体的利益都不应该挑三拣四的.也许只有微粒，除了结合和分解没有其他的方式。那你为什么还要烦恼呢？对你的理性说：“你死了吗？你腐化了吗？你为人虚伪吗？你是否变成了一头野兽？你与他人聚集在一起并和别人休戚与共吗？”

40.神灵要么就拥有力量，要么就没有。那么如果他们没有力量，你为什么还要向神灵祷告呢？但如果神灵拥有力量，那你为什么不向他们祷告赐予你无所畏惧的力量，或是赐予你不再渴求得到你渴望的事物的力量，又或是不再为任何事而痛苦的力量而仅仅祈祷某些事情发生或不发生呢？因为理所当然的，如果神灵可以和人类合作，他们就能与人类为了这样的目的而合作了。但是，也许你想要说，神灵已经把这些能力赐给你了。那好吧，像一个自由人一样运用神灵赐予你的这些能力是不是要比卑躬屈膝地渴求一种你并不具有的才能要好得多呢？而谁又告诉你神灵即便在我们有能力的时候也不帮助我们的呢？那么就开始为诸如此类的事情祈祷吧，你将会见证。当一个人这样祷告：我如何才能得以与这个女人同床共枕呢？而你却这样祷告：我怎样才能消除要与这个女人同床共枕的欲望呢？另一个人这样祷告：我该如何摆脱呢？其他人则这样祷告：我怎样才能消除要摆脱的想法呢？有人这样祷告：我怎样才能不失去我的儿子呢？你则要这样说：我如何才能不害怕失去他呢？总而言之，就像这样改变你祷告的方式，看看会得到什么。

41.伊壁鸠鲁（Epicurus）说：“在病榻上，我谈话并不涉及我身体上的疼痛，”他还说道，“我也不和来看望我的人们讨论这样的话题。我还是继续谈论着万物的性灵，就像往常一样，把下面的作为主要的话题当心灵承担着可怜的肉体的活动时，它是如何远离烦躁，并保持适当良好的状态的呢？”他说：“我也不会给医生用严肃的表情看我的机会，那就好像他们在做什么大事，可我的生活进行得很顺利，我也很开心。”那么如果你也病了或是处于其他危急的情况下，也和他保持相同的态度，做和他一样的事吧永远都不要舍弃哲学的精神，无论你面临什么样的问题，也不要和愚昧之人或不了解自然的人做任何没有意义的谈话，这便是所有哲学流派的一个共同的原则。你要专注的仅仅是你现在进行的事业以及你使用的方法手段。

42.当有人企图用无耻的行为冒犯你时，你要立刻问自己：“这世上没有这样无耻的人可能吗？”当然是不可能的。那么就不要要求不可能的事了。因为这人也是必然存在于世界上的无耻之人中的一个。当你遇到了无赖、背信弃义者或是任何做了坏事的人时，你也要在心里想到这一点。因为只要你想到了这点，你就能提醒自己，总是会有这一类人存在的，这样你就能更加善待每一个人。而当大自然赐予人对抗任何恶行的美德时，能立刻理解这一点也是很有用的。因为她赐予人类抵抗愚昧、荒蛮以及其他劣根性的灵丹妙药。

无论是什么情况，你都有可能劝说那些走上了歧路的人，因为每个犯了错的人都是因为迷失了自己的目标，才误入歧途的。除此以外，你又因何事受到了伤害呢？因为你将会发现那些冒犯你的人中没有人做了能让你的心灵受损害的事，而那些对你有恶意或伤害你的行径只能植根于心灵。

如果一个本就没有恶意的人无意间做了错事，那会伤害谁呢？有什么好奇怪的呢？不妨思虑一下，你是否不应该怪罪你自己呢？因为你事先并没有想到这样的一个人会以这样的方式犯错的。因为你本可以依靠理性的判断事先就想到此人是很有可能犯这样的错的，但是你却忘了要用理性先行判断，你还因他犯的错大为吃惊呢。

在大多数情况下，当你要责备某人背信弃义或是恩将仇报，不如将责备的对象转向你自己。因为，这犯下的过错很显然是你的责任，不管你是相信某个禀赋了这样天性的人会恪守诺言，或是没有以你全部的善意对待他人，也没有使他人从你的行为中得到全部的裨益。当你为人服务时，你还奢求什么呢？你是不满足于自己做了本分内的事却没有得到回报吗？就好像眼睛因为你提供了视觉功能而索要回报，脚因让那个你得以行走而向你讨要回报一样。因为对于这些身体部位，它们的各项功能是为了某种目的才形成的，通过按照它们各自的结构特点工作来获得属于它们自己的东西，就如眼睛获得了视野里的一切景象，而脚收获了脚下走过的道路一样。因此，人也是因要来世上行善，才被大自然母亲创造出来，当他做了善事，或是以某种方式为了集体的利益做出了贡献，他的行为就是符合自身的结构的，而他也能因此得到属于他自己的东西。

1. He who acts unjustly acts impiously. For since the universal nature has made rational animals for the sake of one another to help one another according to their deserts， but in no way to injure one another， he who transgresses her will， is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity. And he too who lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity. for the universal nature is the nature of things that are. and things that are have a relation to all things that come into existence. And further， this universal nature is named truth， and is the prime cause of all things that are true. He then who lies intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly be deceiving. and he also who lies unintentionally， inasmuch as he is at variance with the universal nature， and inasmuch as he disturbs the order by fighting against the nature of the world. for he fights against it， who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth， for he had received powers from nature through the neglect of which he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And indeed he who pursues pleasure as good， and avoids pain as evil， is guilty of impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find fault with the universal nature， alleging that it assigns things to the bad and the good contrary to their deserts， because frequently the bad are in the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things which procure pleasure， but the good have pain for their share and the things which cause pain. And further， he who is afraid of pain will sometimes also be afraid of some of the things which will happen in the world， and even this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain from injustice， and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the things towards which the universal nature is equally affected—for it would not have made both， unless it was equally affected towards both—towards these they who wish to follow nature should be of the same mind with it， and equally affected. With respect to pain， then， and pleasure， or death and life， or honour and dishonour， which the universal nature employs equally， whoever is not equally affected is manifestly acting impiously. And I say that the universal nature employs them equally， instead of saying that they happen alike to those who are produced in continuous series and to those who come after them by virtue of a certain original movement of Providence， according to which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering of things， having conceived certain principles of the things which were to be， and having determined powers productive of beings and of changes and of suchlike successions （vii. 75）.

2. It would be a man’s happiest lot to depart from mankind without having had any taste of lying and hypocrisy and luxury and pride. However to breathe out one’s life when a man has had enough of these things is the next best voyage， as the saying is. Hast thou determined to abide with vice， and has not experience yet induced thee to fly from this pestilence？ For the destruction of the understanding is a pestilence， much more indeed than any such corruption and change of this atmosphere which surrounds us. For this corruption is a pestilence of animals so far as they are animals. but the other is a pestilence of men so far as they are men.

3. Do not despise death， but be well content with it， since this too is one of those things which nature wills. For such as it is to be young and to grow old， and to increase and to reach maturity， and to have teeth and beard and gray hairs， and to beget， and to be pregnant， and to bring forth， and all the other natural operations which the seasons of thy life bring， such also is dissolution. This then， is consistent with the character of a reflecting man， to be neither careless nor impatient nor contemptuous with respect to death， but to wait for it as one of the operations of nature. As thou now waitest for the time when the child shall come out of thy wife’s womb， so be ready for the time when thy soul shall fall out of this envelope. But if thou requirest also a vulgar kind of comfort which shall reach thy heart， thou wilt be made best reconciled to death by observing the objects from which thou art going to be removed， and the morals of those with whom thy soul will no longer be mingled. For it is no way right to be offended with men， but it is thy duty to care for them and to bear with them gently. and yet to remember that thy departure will be not from men who have the same principles as thyself. For this is the only thing， if there be any， which could draw us the contrary way and attach us to life， to be permitted to live with those who have the same principles as ourselves. But now thou seest how great is the trouble arising from the discordance of those who live together， so that thou mayst say， Come quick， O death， lest perchance I， too， should forget myself.

4. He who does wrong does wrong against himself. He who acts unjustly acts unjustly to himself， because he makes himself bad.

5. He often acts unjustly who does not do a certain thing. not only he who does a certain thing.

6. Thy present opinion founded on understanding， and thy present conduct directed to social good， and thy present disposition of contentment with everything which happens—that is enough.

7. Wipe out imagination： check desire： extinguish appetite： keep the ruling faculty in its own power.

8. Among the animals which have not reason one life is distributed. but among reasonable animals one intelligent soul is distributed： just as there is one earth of all things which are of an earthy nature， and we see by one light， and breathe one air， all of us that have the faculty of vision and all that have life.

9. All things which participate in anything which is common to them all move towards that which is of the same kind with themselves. Everything which is earthy turns towards the earth， everything which is liquid flows together， and everything which is of an arial kind does the same， so that they require something to keep them asunder， and the application of force. Fire indeed moves upwards on account of the elemental fire， but it is so ready to be kindled together with all the fire which is here， that even every substance which is somewhat dry， is easily ignited， because there is less mingled with it of that which is a hindrance to ignition. Accordingly then everything also which participates in the common intelligent nature moves in like manner towards that which is of the same kind with itself， or moves even more. For so much as it is superior in comparison with all other things， in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle with and to be fused with that which is akin to it. Accordingly among animals devoid of reason we find swarms of bees， and herds of cattle， and the nurture of young birds， and in a manner， loves. for even in animals there are souls， and that power which brings them together is seen to exert itself in the superior degree， and in such a way as never has been observed in plants nor in stones nor in trees. But in rational animals there are political communities and friendships， and families and meetings of people. and in wars， treaties and armistices. But in the things which are still superior， even though they are separated from one another， unity in a manner exists， as in the stars. Thus the ascent to the higher degree is able to produce a sympathy even in things which are separated. See then what now takes place. For only intelligent animals have now forgotten this mutual desire and inclination， and in them alone the property of flowing together is not seen. But still， though men strive to avoid [this union]， they are caught and held by it， for their nature is too strong for them. and thou wilt see what I say， if thou only observest. Sooner then will one find anything earthy which comes in contact with no earthy thing than a man altogether separated from other men.

10. Both man and God and the universe produce fruit. at the proper seasons each produces it. But if usage has especially fixed these terms to the vine and like things， this is nothing. Reason produces fruit both for all and for itself， and there are produced from it other things of the same kind as reason itself.

11. If thou art able， correct by teaching those who do wrong. but if thou canst not， remember that indulgence is given to thee for this purpose. And the gods， too， are indulgent to such persons. and for some purposes they even help them to get health， wealth， reputation. so kind they are. And it is in thy power also. or say， who hinders thee？

12. Labour not as one who is wretched， nor yet as one who would be pitied or admired. but direct thy will to one thing only， to put thyself in motion and to check thyself， as the social reason requires.

13. To-day I have got out of all trouble， or rather I have cast out all trouble， for it was not outside， but within and in my opinions.

14. All things are the same， familiar in experience， and ephemeral in time， and worthless in the matter. Everything now is just as it was in the time of those whom we have buried.

15. Things stand outside of us， themselves by themselves， neither knowing aught of themselves， nor expressing any judgment. What is it， then， which does judge about them？ The ruling faculty.

16. Not in passivity， but in activity， lie the evil and the good of the rational social animal， just as his virtue and his vice lie not in passivity， but in activity.

17. For the stone which has been thrown up it is no evil to come down， nor indeed any good to have been carried up （viii. 20）.

18. Penetrate inwards into men’s leading principles， and thou wilt see what judges thou art afraid of， and what kind of judges they are of themselves.

19. All things are changing. and thou thyself art in continuous mutation and in a manner in continuous destruction， and the whole universe too.

20. It is thy duty to leave another man’s wrongful act there where it is （vii. 29. ix. 38）.

21. Termination of activity， cessation from movement and opinion， and in a sense their death， is no evil. Turn thy thoughts now to the consideration of thy life， thy life as a child， as a youth， thy manhood， thy old age， for in these also every change was a death. Is this anything to fear？ Turn thy thoughts now to thy life under thy grandfather， then to thy life under thy mother， then to thy life under thy father. and as thou findest many other differences and changes and terminations， ask thyself， Is this anything to fear？ In like manner， then， neither are the termination and cessation and change of thy whole life a thing to be afraid of.

22. Hasten [to examine] thy own ruling faculty and that of the universe and that of thy neighbour： thy own， that thou mayst make it just. and that of the universe， that thou mayst remember of what thou art a part. and that of thy neighbour， that thou mayst know whether he has acted ignorantly or with knowledge， and that thou mayst also consider that his ruling faculty is akin to thine.

23. As thou thyself art a component part of a social system， so let every act of thine be a component part of social life. Whatever act of thine then has no reference， either immediately or remotely， to a social end， this tears asunder thy life， and does not allow it to be one， and it is of the nature of a mutiny， just as when in a popular assembly a man acting by himself stands apart from the general agreement.

24. Quarrels of little children and their sports， and poor spirits carrying about dead bodies [such is everything]. and so what is exhibited in the representation of the mansions of the dead strikes our eyes more clearly.

25. Examine into the quality of the form of an object， and detach it altogether from its material part， and then contemplate it. then determine the time， the longest which a thing of this peculiar form is naturally made to endure.

26. Thou hast endured infinite troubles through not being contented with thy ruling faculty， when it does the things which it is constituted by nature to do. But enough [of this].

27. When another blames thee or hates thee， or when men say about thee anything injurious， approach their poor souls， penetrate within， and see what kind of men they are. Thou wilt discover that there is no reason to take any trouble that these men may have this or that opinion about thee. However thou must be well-disposed towards them， for by nature they are friends. And the gods too aid them in all ways， by dreams， by signs， towards the attainment of those things on which they set a value.

28. The periodic movements of the universe are the same， up and down from age to age. And either the universal intelligence puts itself in motion for every separate effect， and if this is so， be thou content with that which is the result of its activity. or it puts itself in motion once， and everything else comes by way of sequence in a manner. or indivisible elements are the origin of all things. In a word， if there is a god， all is well. and if chance rules， do not thou also be governed by it （vi. 44. vii. 75）.

Soon will the earth cover us all： then the earth， too， will change， and the things also which result from change will continue to change forever， and these again forever. For if a man reflects on the changes and transformations which follow one another like wave after wave and their rapidity， he will despise everything which is perishable （xii. 21）.

29. The universal cause is like a winter torrent： it carries everything along with it. But how worthless are all these poor people who are engaged in matters political， and， as they suppose， are playing the philosopher！ All drivelers. Well then， man： do what nature now requires. Set thyself in motion， if it is in thy power， and do not look about thee to see if any one will observe it. nor yet expect Plato’s Republic： but be content if the smallest thing goes on well， and consider such an event to be no small matter. For who can change men’s opinions？ And without a change of opinions what else is there than the slavery of men who groan while they pretend to obey？ Come now and tell me of Alexander and Philippus and Demetrius and Phalerum. They themselves shall judge whether they discovered what the common nature required， and trained themselves accordingly. But if they acted like tragedy heroes， no one has condemned me to imitate them. Simple and modest is the work of philosophy. Draw me not aside to insolence and pride.

30. Look down from above on the countless herds of men and their countless solemnities， and the infinitely varied voyagings in storms and calms， and the differences among those who are born， who live together， and die. And consider， too， the life lived by others in olden time， and the life of those who will live after thee， and the life now lived among barbarous nations， and how many know not even thy name， and how many will soon forget it， and how they who perhaps now are praising thee will very soon blame thee， and that neither a posthumous name is of any value， nor reputation， nor anything else.

31. Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to the things which come from the external cause. and let there be justice in the things done by virtue of the internal cause， that is， let there be movement and action terminating in this， in social acts， for this is according to thy nature.

32. Thou canst remove out of the way many useless things among those which disturb thee， for they lie entirely in thy opinion. and thou wilt then gain for thyself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in thy mind， and by contemplating the eternity of time， and observing the rapid change of every several thing， how short is the time from birth to dissolution， and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution.

33. All that thou seest will quickly perish， and those who have been spectators of its dissolution will very soon perish too. And he who dies at the extremest old age will be brought into the same condition with him who died prematurely.

34. What are these men’s leading principles， and about what kind of things are they busy， and for what kind of reasons do they love and honour？ Imagine that thou seest their poor souls laid bare. When they think that they do harm by their blame or good by their praise， what an idea！

35. Loss is nothing else than change. But the universal nature delights in change， and in obedience to her all things are now done well， and from eternity have been done in like form， and will be such to time without end. What then dost thou say？ That all things have been and all things always will be bad， and that no power has ever been found in so many gods to rectify these things， but the world has been condemned to be bound in never-ceasing evil？ （iv. 45. vii. 18）.

36. The rottenness of the matter which is the foundation of everything！ water， dust， bones， filth. or again， marble rocks， the callosities of the earth. and gold and silver， the sediments. and garments， only bits of hair. and purple dye， blood. and everything else is of the same kind. And that which is of the nature of breath， is also another thing of the same kind， changing from this to that.

37. Enough of this wretched life and murmuring and apish tricks. Why art thou disturbed？ What is there new in this？ What unsettles thee？ Is it the form of the thing？ Look at it. Or is it the matter？ Look at it. But besides these there is nothing. Towards the gods， then， now become at last more simple and better. It is the same whether we examine these things for a hundred years or three.

38. If any man has done wrong， the harm is his own. But perhaps he has not done wrong.

39. Either all things proceed from one intelligent source and come together as in one body， and the part ought not to find fault with what is done for the benefit of the whole. or there are only atoms， and nothing else than mixture and dispersion. Why， then， art thou disturbed？ Say to the ruling faculty， Art thou dead， art thou corrupted， art thou playing the hypocrite， art thou become a beast， dost thou herd and feed with the rest？

40. Either the gods have no power or they have power. If， then， they have no power， why dost thou pray to them？ But if they have power， why dost thou not pray for them to give thee the faculty of not fearing any of the things which thou fearest， or of not desiring any of the things which thou desirest， or not being pained at anything， rather than pray that any of these things should not happen or happen？ for certainly if they can co-operate with men， they can co-operate for these purposes. But perhaps thou wilt say， the gods have placed them in thy power. Well， then， is it not better to use what is in thy power like a free man than to desire in a slavish and abject way what is not in thy power？ And who has told thee that the gods do not aid us even in the things which are in our power？ Begin， then， to pray for such things， and thou wilt see. One man prays thus： How shall I be able to lie with that woman？ Do thou prays thus： How shall I not desire to lie with her？ Another prays thus： How shall I be released from this？ Another prays： How shall I not desire to be released？ Another thus： How shall I not lose my little son？ Thou thus： How shall I not be afraid to lose him？ In fine， turn thy prayers this way， and see what comes.

41. Epicurus says， In my sickness my conversation was not about my bodily sufferings， nor， says he， did I talk on such subjects to those who visited me. but I continued to discourse on the nature of things as before， keeping to this main point， how the mind， while participating in such movements as go on in the poor flesh， shall be free from perturbations and maintain its proper good. Nor did I， he says， give the physicians an opportunity of putting on solemn looks， as if they were doing something great， but my life went on well and happily. Do， then， the same that he did both in sickness， if thou art sick， and in any other circumstances. for never to desert philosophy in any events that may befall us， nor to hold trifling talk either with an ignorant man or with one unacquainted with nature， is a principle of all schools of philosophy. but to be intent only on that which thou art now doing and on the instrument by which thou doest it.

42. When thou art offended with any man’s shameless conduct， immediately ask thyself， Is it possible， then， that shameless men should not be in the world？ It is not possible. Do not， then， require what is impossible. For this man also is one of those shameless men who must of necessity be in the world. Let the same considerations be present to thy mind in the case of the knave， and the faithless man， and of every man who does wrong in any way. For at the same time that thou dost remind thyself that it is impossible that such kind of men should not exist， thou wilt become more kindly disposed towards every one individually. It is useful to perceive this， too， immediately when the occasion arises， what virtue nature has given to man to oppose to every wrongful act. For she has given to man， as an antidote against the stupid man， mildness， and against another kind of man some other power. And in all cases it is possible for thee to correct by teaching the man who is gone astray. for every man who errs misses his object and is gone astray. Besides wherein hast thou been injured？ For thou wilt find that no one among those against whom thou art irritated has done anything by which thy mind could be made worse. but that which is evil to thee and harmful has its foundation only in the mind. And what harm is done or what is there strange， if the man who has not been instructed does the acts of an uninstructed man？ Consider whether thou shouldst not rather blame thyself， because thou didst not expect such a man to err in such a way. For thou hadst means given thee by thy reason to suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error， and yet thou hast forgotten and art amazed that he has erred. But most of all when thou blamest a man as faithless or ungrateful， turn to thyself. For the fault is manifestly thy own， whether thou didst trust that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise， or when conferring thy kindness thou didst not confer it absolutely， nor yet in such way as to have received from thy very act all the profit. For what more dost thou want when thou hast done a man a service？ Art thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to thy nature， and dost thou seek to be paid for it？ Just as if the eye demanded a recompense for seeing， or the feet for walking. For as these members are formed for a particular purpose， and by working according to their several constitutions obtain what is their own. so also as man is formed by nature to acts of benevolence， when he has done anything benevolent or in any other way conducive to the common interest， he has acted conformably to his constitution， and he gets what is his own.
