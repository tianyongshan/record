Book Three 卷三

别让肉体控制你的灵魂

1.我们需要担心的不只是我们的日子一天天地过去，剩下的时光越来越短，还有一件事我们也不得不去考虑，那就是，即使生命仍在继续，我们却不敢肯定我们对事物的理解力也会继续，我们是否仍旧可以思考关于上帝、关于人类的问题？因为，如果人逐渐衰老昏聩，他仍会出汗，仍然需要营养，仍会时不时地幻想一番，仍旧会觉得饥饿，诸如此类的一切活动依然在继续.但是有一种能力，那种可以使我们充分发挥自己的优势，恪尽职责，辨别是非，使我们明白一个人是否将不久于人世等诸如此类需要发挥理智作用的问题所必不可少的能力，却已不复存在。因此我们必须抓紧时间，不仅仅因为我们一天比一天接近死亡，还因为我们理解事物、思考事物的能力甚至会比生命更先一步停止。

2.我们还应该注意到，甚至是那些伴随着别的事物而生的东西，其本身也有令人愉快、吸引人的一面。比如，烤面包的时候面包的表皮会出现开裂，这些开裂的部分虽然有悖于面包师的初衷，从某种意义上来说却是美的，而且以其特有的方式使人垂涎欲滴。再比如无花果，当它熟到一定程度就裂开了口.还有橄榄，当其成熟几近腐烂的时候却给人一种特殊的美感。再如苞米低垂的穗，狮子的浓眉，野猪嘴里的涎水，以及其它许许多多的东西——虽然远远谈不上什么美，但如果认真审视一下——仍不失为一种装饰，让我们觉得愉快，因为它们本身就是自然事物的一部分.因此，如果人对宇宙中的一切事物都怀有一种情感，对事物有更深的了解，那么在他看来，几乎任何事物都有其令人愉快的一面。因此，哪怕是真的看到野兽龇咧的大嘴，其愉快感比起欣赏画家或雕刻家的模仿之作来说也会毫不逊色.在老人身上他能看到那种成熟从容的美.他可以用纯洁的目光欣赏青年人那充满魅力的可爱.许许多多诸如此类的事物，尽管并非在每个人看来都是那么赏心悦目，但是对那些，也只有对那些真正了解大自然及自然界一切事物的人来说却毋庸置疑。

3.希腊名医希波克拉底一生治病救人无数，但自己最后也为疾病所困命丧黄泉。东方的算命先生们曾预言无数人的生死，但最终谁都无法摆脱自己的命运。亚历山大大帝、罗马政治家兼军事将领庞培、尤利乌斯·恺撒大帝曾使一座座城池变成废墟，战场上让千千万万的士兵身首异处，却终究也没能免得一死。希腊哲学家赫拉克利特曾作过宇宙燃烧的无数次推断，最终却溺水而亡，死时身上泥泞斑驳。而希腊的另外两位哲学大师德谟克利特与苏格拉底最终都死于小人之手。所有这些意味着什么？你登上航船，驶过旅途，到达彼岸，上得岸来。如果这次旅行是通往来生，那么无须神的存在，不管今生还是来世。但如果是为了达到一种没有知觉的状态，那么从此将不再为痛苦或快乐所烦扰，不再是生活的奴隶：彼岸是智慧与神明，而此岸只有世俗与堕落。

4.即使当我们没有什么实际问题可以考虑的时候，也不要将我们剩余的生命浪费在猜测别人如何上，因为当我们在关注别人时，想他在做什么，为什么这么做，猜他说什么、想什么、搞什么鬼等诸如此类的事时，我们就无法再关注自己的能力，从而会失去很多做别的事情的机会。一切无用的思想都应该制止，尤其是那些过于好奇或恶意的情感倾向。人的思想应仅限于那些当别人问及你在想什么时，你可以毫不犹豫地坦诚所面对的问题。这样你的话语就能清楚地展现出你内心的简单与善意，展现出一个有益于社会的人，而不是一个只想着肉体快乐或享受的人，内心不含任何敌意、嫉妒、猜疑或其它什么如果说出来让自己感到脸红的思想。这样的人是首屈一指的人，就好比是诸神中的牧师，他们充分发挥了自己内心的神性，从而使自己不为快乐所扰，痛苦所困，面对别人的侮辱可以丝毫不受影响，没有任何的罪恶感，是神圣战争中的勇士，不会被激情淹没，永远正直无私，敞开心胸，打开灵魂，接受命运安排的一切.并非经常，但必要时为着公众利益，也会想象他人在说什么、做什么、想什么。他仅为着本来属于自己的东西而奋斗.不断地思索着命运分配给自己的一切，力求使自己的行为公平，坚信自己有一个好命运，因为一个人的命运会伴其一生，人终其一生都无法摆脱命运的安排。他牢记，一切理性动物皆是兄弟而且关心他人是人性的体现.人不应附和所有人的观点，但那些按自然法则生活的人，他们的观点却一定要尊重。对于那些不按自然法则生活的人，他时刻牢记他们在家是什么样的人，在外又是什么样的人，晚上什么样，白天又什么样，他们都干什么，又跟什么人在一起混。因而如果这些人甜言蜜语地来奉承，他也不会沾沾自喜，因为他明白这些人甚至对自己都不满意，又怎么可能会真心实意地夸赞别人呢。

5.如果行动就要心甘情愿，考虑过利害关系，经过深思熟虑之后，就要全心全意地去努力.切莫流于形式而不假思考，切莫只说大话，或样样通而样样不精。让我们内心的神性成为我们生命的守护神，守护我们长大、成熟，而我们则像政治家、像统治者一样，恪守着自己的职位，时刻等待着生命的信号，随时准备出发，无须向谁宣誓，也无须有谁作证。要满怀乐观，不要寻求外界的帮助，也不要期望别人能给我们宁静。人的确需要挺立在天地间，但不是在别人的帮助下。

6.如果你发现人生中能有什么比正义、真理、克己、坚毅更加美好，简而言之，有什么能比无须选择就自动促使你行动起来的思想的自我满足更加美好的事物，那就全身心地奔向它吧，享受你发现的最美好之物。如果没有什么比你内心的神性更加美好，它帮你一一过滤所有的欲望，一丝不苟地审视众多的印象，正如苏格拉底所说，它远离了直觉的干扰，服从神的意志，关注着人类.如果你没有发现什么比这更美好、更伟大、更有价值，那么就永远都不要放弃它至高无上的地位，一旦放弃，一旦偏离，就再不是全心全意地倾向于我们生命中拥有的那美好之物了.因为在理性上、理论上、情理上美好的事物，是任何其它事物，如他人的赞美、权力、享乐等都无法相媲美的。此类事物虽然看似是有那么一点在迎合我们的美好之物，却会趁机夺取它至高无上的地位，让我们迷失自己。那么照我说就直接选择美好的事物吧，并且要一直坚持这个选择——但什么有用什么就叫美好啊，你也许会说了——是有这一说的，如果某个东西在作为理性动物的你看来是有用的，那么它就是你的首选但如果仅对于作为动物的你来说是有用的，还是相信你理性的判断吧但要注意必须有合适的区分之法。

7.不管是什么东西，如果它迫使你背叛承诺、丧失自尊、憎恨他人、心生疑虑或诅咒、变得虚伪，让你产生见不得人的任何欲望，那么永远都不要将其视为有益之物：将智慧、守护神及守护神之崇拜视为至高无上之人，他不狡诈行动，也不暴跳如雷，将不会获得所有的尊敬和同情.简言之，他既无轻生之念，亦无惧于死亡.也不会在乎生命之长短：哪怕死亡就在眼前，他也会像对待任何其它事情一样，不失那份从容与高贵.终其一生只在乎一件事，那就是，只关注一个理性的人，一个文明社会的成员应该做的一切。

再宝贵的荣誉也不过是过眼烟云

8.纯洁干净的灵魂没有任何堕落、污秽，亦没有任何伤痛。即使生命突然间结束也不会有任何的遗憾，不像人们说某个演员突然离开舞台那样，“遗恨终生”。在他身上看不到任何奴颜婢膝或矫揉造作，对任何东西既不刻意追求亦不刻意疏远，没有任何可谴责之处，也没有任何见不得人的地方。

9.要尊重我们理性思维的器官。正是这一器官决定我们头脑中是否存在与自然和理性不相协调的因素.而且正是得益于这一器官，我们才得以避免做出草率的决定，才有人与人之间的友谊长存，才有对诸神的恭敬虔诚。

10.抛弃一切浮华，珍惜眼前的时光.时刻牢记，每个人所能把握的只有眼前看得见的短暂时光，过去的已经过去，未来的飘忽不定，均非我们力所能及。每个人的生命之光都是短暂的，生存之所是有限的.人死后名字还能流传多久呢？再显赫的人物，也会很快被人淡忘，更何况只有活人才有记忆，而活人也会很快死去，死后甚至连自己都不记得，又怎么可能还记得在他们之前就死了多少年的人呢！

11.除上述种种建议之外还需再添加一条对任何呈现到眼前的事物都要下一个精确的定义或进行详尽的描述，因为只有这样才能从实质上、从整体上把握其本质.明确其名称，确定其由什么构成，又会分解成什么。因为对于思想的升华来说，还没有什么比对呈现到我们生命中的事物有条不紊地加以研究更加有效呢。看见什么都要想一想这是一种什么样的宇宙现象，其各个构成部分又是怎样运转，部分对于整体而言有什么价值，它对于最高级社会的成员——人类而言又有什么价值.弄清楚每一事物的本质，明确其构成，弄清其眼前的形态能维系多久，我们又为何会需要它，比如是因为我们渴望温柔、男性气概、真相、忠诚、简单、满足，等等，还是其它什么原因。面对任何事情我们都应说：这是上帝的旨意.这是命运的牵引，是机缘巧合.这是我们同伴的安排，而其之所以这样做纯粹是其天性使然.因此我们在处理与他人的关系时也要本着我们的天性，本着善意、公正的原则。然而与此同时，也要衡量一下其与那些无关事物之间的价值关系。

12.如果你能在理智、严格、冷静、客观的指引下全神贯注于眼前的事物而毫不分神，好像随时都可能有人将它带走那样.如果你能像这样坚持下去，无所期待亦无所恐惧，只有对于眼前的事物，对于自己所说的每一句话（没有一句谎言）都满足，那么你就是一个幸福的人，而且没有人可以阻止你的幸福。

13.就像医生身边总带着药具以备随时治病救人一样，我们也有自己的原则方法以备随时理解思考事情，而我们要做的事情无论再小，也不要忘记神圣与世俗之间的关系，因为，任何世俗的事情如果做好了就是一件神圣的事，反之亦然。

14.不要再漫无目的地徘徊，因为当你真的老了的时候，你不会读自己的自传，不会阅读希腊、罗马人的生活，也不会阅读年轻时为自己备下的名著选读。抓紧时间朝着命运规划的人生目标努力吧，如果是真的爱自己，就抛弃那些空洞的幻想，趁着自己还有能力的时候帮助自己去实现这一目标吧。

15.很多人不知道“偷窃”、“播种”、“购物”、“安静”、“明确自己该做什么”等究竟有多少种含义，这是因为它不是凭眼睛就能看得出来的，而是需要凭借另一种形式的“视力”。

16.对于肉体、灵魂和智慧而言，声色感觉属于肉体，欲望属于灵魂，而原则属于智慧。仅凭外表而定印象是动物的行为.受欲望牵引的则是野兽或受女人控制的男人.仅凭智慧去实现看似合理的目的是不信神的人的行为，是可能背叛自己国家、关起门来可能干坏事的人的行为，是像暴君法拉利斯和尼禄之类的人会做的事。如果说上面我提到的那些都是一个普通人所具有的话，有一样是只有好人所特有的，那就是满足于现有的一切，满足于命运的安排.崇拜内心的神性，不去打扰它，给它宁静，像对待真神一样地毕恭毕敬，言语不悖事实，行动不悖良心。即使没有人相信他简单、谦恭、怡然的生活，他也不愠不怒，更不会因此偏离了自己的人生路，而沿着这条路走下去的人会变得纯洁，宁静，超然于生死，让一切听从命运的安排。

1.We ught to consider not only that our life is daily wasting away and a smaller part of it is left， but another thing also must be taken into the account， that if a man should live longer， it is quite uncertain whether the understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension of things， and retain the power of contemplation which strives to acquire the knowledge of the divine and the human. For if he shall begin to fall into dotage， perspiration and nutrition and imagination and appetite， and whatever else there is of the kind， will not fail. but the power of making use of ourselves， and filling up the measure of our duty， and clearly separating all appearances， and considering whether a man should now depart from life， and whatever else of the kind absolutely requires a disciplined reason， all this is already extinguished. We must make haste then， not only because we are daily nearer to death， but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first.

2.We ought to observe also that even the things which follow after the things which are produced according to nature contain something pleasing and attractive. For instance， when bread is baked some parts are split at the surface， and these parts which thus open， and have a certain fashion contrary to the purpose of the baker's art， are beautiful in a manner， and in a peculiar way excite a desire for eating. And again， figs， when they are quite ripe， gape open. and in the ripe olives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the ears of corn bending down， and the lion's eyebrows， and the foam which flows from the mouth of wild boars， and many other things- though they are far from being beautiful， if a man should examine them severally- still， because they are consequent upon the things which are formed by nature， help to adorn them， and they please the mind. so that if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are produced in the universe， there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give pleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which painters and sculptors show by imitation. and in an old woman and an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness. and the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to look on with chaste eyes. and many such things will present themselves， not pleasing to every man， but to him only who has become truly familiar with nature and her works.

3.Hippocrates after curing many diseases himself fell sick and died. The Chaldaei foretold the deaths of many， and then fate caught them too. Alexander， and Pompeius， and Caius Caesar， after so often completely destroying whole cities， and in battle cutting to pieces many ten thousands of cavalry and infantry， themselves too at last departed from life. Heraclitus， after so many speculations on the conflagration of the universe， was filled with water internally and died smeared all over with mud. And lice destroyed Democritus. and other lice killed Socrates. What means all this？ Thou hast embarked， thou hast made the voyage， thou art come to shore. get out. If indeed to another life， there is no want of gods， not even there. But if to a state without sensation， thou wilt cease to be held by pains and pleasures， and to be a slave to the vessel， which is as much inferior as that which serves it is superior： for the one is intelligence and deity. the other is earth and corruption.

4.Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others， when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility. For thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou hast such thoughts as these， What is such a person doing， and why， and what is he saying， and what is he thinking of， and what is he contriving， and whatever else of the kind makes us wander away from the observation of our own ruling power. We ought then to check in the series of our thoughts everything that is without a purpose and useless， but most of all the over-curious feeling and the malignant. and a man should use himself to think of those things only about which if one should suddenly ask， What hast thou now in thy thoughts？ With perfect openness thou mightest， immediately answer， This or That. so that from thy words it should be plain that everything in thee is simple and benevolent， and such as befits a social animal， and one that cares not for thoughts about pleasure or sensual enjoyments at all， nor has any rivalry or envy and suspicion， or anything else for which thou wouldst blush if thou shouldst say that thou hadst it in thy mind. For the man who is such and no longer delays being among the number of the best， is like a priest and minister of the gods， using too the deity which is planted within him， which makes the man uncontaminated by pleasure， unharmed by any pain， untouched by any insult， feeling no wrong， a fighter in the noblest fight， one who cannot be overpowered by any passion， dyed deep with justice， accepting with all his soul everything which happens and is assigned to him as his portion. and not often， nor yet without great necessity and for the general interest， imagining what another says， or does， or thinks. For it is only what belongs to himself that he makes the matter for his activity. and he constantly thinks of that which is allotted to himself out of the sum total of things， and he makes his own acts fair， and he is persuaded that his own portion is good. For the lot which is assigned to each man is carried along with him and carries him along with it. And he remembers also that every rational animal is his kinsman， and that to care for all men is according to man's nature. and a man should hold on to the opinion not of all， but of those only who confessedly live according to nature. But as to those who live not so， he always bears in mind what kind of men they are both at home and from home， both by night and by day， and what they are， and with what men they live an impure life. Accordingly， he does not value at all the praise which comes from such men， since they are not even satisfied with themselves.

5.Labour not unwillingly， nor without regard to the common interest， nor without due consideration， nor with distraction. nor let studied ornament set off thy thoughts， and be not either a man of many words， or busy about too many things. And further， let the deity which is in thee be the guardian of a living being， manly and of ripe age， and engaged in matter political， and a Roman， and a ruler， who has taken his post like a man waiting for the signal which summons him from life， and ready to go， having need neither of oath nor of any man's testimony. Be cheerful also， and seek not external help nor the tranquility which others give. A man then must stand erect， not be kept erect by others.

6.If thou findest in human life anything better than justice， truth， temperance， fortitude， and， in a word， anything better than thy own mind's self-satisfaction in the things which it enables thee to do according to right reason， and in the condition that is assigned to thee without thy own choice. if， I say， thou seest anything better than this， turn to it with all thy soul， and enjoy that which thou hast found to be the best. But if nothing appears to be better than the deity which is planted in thee， which has subjected to itself all thy appetites， and carefully examines all the impressions， and， as Socrates said， has detached itself from the persuasions of sense， and has submitted itself to the gods， and cares for mankind. if thou findest everything else smaller and of less value than this， give place to nothing else， for if thou dost once diverge and incline to it， thou wilt no longer without distraction be able to give the preference to that good thing which is thy proper possession and thy own. for it is not right that anything of any other kind， such as praise from the many， or power， or enjoyment of pleasure， should come into competition with that which is rationally and politically or practically good. All these things， even though they may seem to adapt themselves to the better things in a small degree， obtain the superiority all at once， and carry us away. But do thou， I say， simply and freely choose the better， and hold to it.- But that which is useful is the better.- Well then， if it is useful to thee as a rational being， keep to it. but if it is only useful to thee as an animal， say so， and maintain thy judgement without arrogance： only take care that thou makest the inquiry by a sure method.

7.Never value anything as profitable to thyself which shall compel thee to break thy promise， to lose thy self-respect， to hate any man， to suspect， to curse， to act the hypocrite， to desire anything which needs walls and curtains： for he who has preferred to everything intelligence and daemon and the worship of its excellence， acts no tragic part， does not groan， will not need either solitude or much company. and， what is chief of all， he will live without either pursuing or flying from death. but whether for a longer or a shorter time he shall have the soul inclosed in the body， he cares not at all： for even if he must depart immediately， he will go as readily as if he were going to do anything else which can be done with decency and order. taking care of this only all through life， that his thoughts turn not away from anything which belongs to an intelligent animal and a member of a civil community.

8.In the mind of one who is chastened and purified thou wilt find no corrupt matter， nor impurity， nor any sore skinned over. Nor is his life incomplete when fate overtakes him， as one may say of an actor who leaves the stage before ending and finishing the play. Besides， there is in him nothing servile， nor affected， nor too closely bound to other things， nor yet detached from other things， nothing worthy of blame， nothing which seeks a hiding-place.

9.Reverence the faculty which produces opinion. On this faculty it entirely depends whether there shall exist in thy ruling part any opinion inconsistent with nature and the constitution of the rational animal. And this faculty promises freedom from hasty judgement， and friendship towards men， and obedience to the gods.

10.Throwing away then all things， hold to these only which are few. and besides bear in mind that every man lives only this present time， which is an indivisible point， and that all the rest of his life is either past or it is uncertain. Short then is the time which every man lives， and small the nook of the earth where he lives. and short too the longest posthumous fame， and even this only continued by a succession of poor human beings， who will very soon die， and who know not even themselves， much less him who died long ago.

11.To the aids which have been mentioned let this one still be added：- Make for thyself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to thee， so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance， in its nudity， in its complete entirety， and tell thyself its proper name， and the names of the things of which it has been compounded， and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object which is presented to thee in life， and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is， and what kind of use everything performs in it， and what value everything has with reference to the whole， and what with reference to man， who is a citizen of the highest city， of which all other cities are like families. what each thing is， and of what it is composed， and how long it is the nature of this thing to endure which now makes an impression on me， and what virtue I have need of with respect to it， such as gentleness， manliness， truth， fidelity， simplicity， contentment， and the rest. Wherefore， on every occasion a man should say： this comes from God. and this is according to the apportionment and spinning of the thread of destiny， and such-like coincidence and chance. and this is from one of the same stock， and a kinsman and partner， one who knows not however what is according to his nature. But I know. for this reason I behave towards him according to the natural law of fellowship with benevolence and justice. At the same time however in things indifferent I attempt to ascertain the value of each.

12.If thou workest at that which is before thee， following right reason seriously， vigorously， calmly， without allowing anything else to distract thee， but keeping thy divine part pure， as if thou shouldst be bound to give it back immediately. if thou holdest to this， expecting nothing， fearing nothing， but satisfied with thy present activity according to nature， and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest， thou wilt live happy. And there is no man who is able to prevent this.

13.As physicians have always their instruments and knives ready for cases which suddenly require their skill， so do thou have principles ready for the understanding of things divine and human， and for doing everything， even the smallest， with a recollection of the bond which unites the divine and human to one another. For neither wilt thou do anything well which pertains to man without at the same time having a reference to things divine. nor the contrary.

14.No longer wander at hazard. for neither wilt thou read thy own memoirs， nor the acts of the ancient Romans and Hellenes， and the selections from books which thou wast reserving for thy old age. Hasten then to the end which thou hast before thee， and throwing away idle hopes， come to thy own aid， if thou carest at all for thyself， while it is in thy power.

15.They know not how many things are signified by the words stealing， sowing， buying， keeping quiet， seeing what ought to be done. for this is not effected by the eyes， but by another kind of vision.

16.Body， soul， intelligence： to the body belong sensations， to the soul appetites， to the intelligence principles. To receive the impressions of forms by means of appearances belongs even to animals. to be pulled by the strings of desire belongs both to wild beasts and to men who have made themselves into women， and to a Phalaris and a Nero： and to have the intelligence that guides to the things which appear suitable belongs also to those who do not believe in the gods， and who betray their country， and do their impure deeds when they have shut the doors. If then everything else is common to all that I have mentioned， there remains that which is peculiar to the good man， to be pleased and content with what happens， and with the thread which is spun for him. and not to defile the divinity which is planted in his breast， nor disturb it by a crowd of images， but to preserve it tranquil， following it obediently as a god， neither saying anything contrary to the truth， nor doing anything contrary to justice. And if all men refuse to believe that he lives a simple， modest， and contented life， he is neither angry with any of them， nor does he deviate from the way which leads to the end of life， to which a man ought to come pure， tranquil， ready to depart， and without any compulsion perfectly reconciled to his lot.
