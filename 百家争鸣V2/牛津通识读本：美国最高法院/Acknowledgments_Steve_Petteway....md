Acknowledgments

Steve Petteway, the Supreme Court's photographer, was generous with his time in helping me select most of the photographs that appear in this book. This is my second book to benefit from Steve's professional enthusiasm, and I thank him once again. I thank Sanford Levinson for his comments on the manuscript, and my husband and fellow law teacher, Eugene Fidell, for having read each chapter as it emerged. My editor, Nancy Toff, recruited me for this project and helped me to envision a world full of curious English-speaking readers who want to know more about the U.S. Supreme Court. I'm glad she did.
