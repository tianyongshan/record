Chapter 1

The activities of the Justices while riding circuit are discussed in detail in volumes 2 (1989) and 3 (1990) of The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789–1800 (New York: Columbia University Press). John Jay's letter to John Adams, declining the president's offer of resuming the position of Chief Justice, is reprinted in The Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay, ed. Henry P. Johnson (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1890), 4:284–85. It is cited in Michael J. Klarman's interesting article, “How Great Were the ‘Great’ Marshall Court Decisions?”Virginia Law Review 87:1111, 1154, n. 226.

For a recent citation of John Marshall's famous line about the Court's “province and duty” to “say what the law is,” see the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in Boumediene v. Bush, invalidating an act of Congress that stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear cases brought by detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy said that “[t]o hold the political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will . . . would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government, leading to a regime in which Congress and the President, not this Court, say ‘what the law is’” [citing Marbury].

Chapter 2

The Supreme Court's Rule 13 provides that petitions for certiorari must be filed within ninety days from the lower court's entry of“final judgment.” The rule for judicial deference to an agency's plausible interpretation of an ambiguous statute is set out in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council (1984). The doctrine is known as “Chevron deference.”

Chapter 3

For illustrations and analysis of the ways in which Justices have shifted over time from their original ideological positions, see the article by Lee Epstein and her co-authors, “Ideological Drift Among Supreme Court Justices: Who, When, and How Important?”Northwestern Law Review Colloquy 101 (2007): 127–31. The scholar who identified the presence or absence of prior executive branch experience as predictive of a new Supreme Court justice's eventual ideological shift was Michael C. Dorf in his article “Does Federal Executive Branch Experience Explain Why Some Republican Supreme Court Justices ‘Evolve’ and Others Don't?” Harvard Law& Policy Review 1 (2007): 457–76. The six justices in Dorf's “no experience” group were Blackmun, Powell, Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter. In the “experienced” group were Burger, Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas, Roberts, and Alito. While this study was concluded very early in the tenures of Roberts and Alito, the author noted that “preliminary evidence indicates that the pattern will also hold” for them. The scholar who examined a nominee's geographic origin as a factor was Lawrence Baum in his book Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006). On this topic, see also my article “Change and Continuity on the Supreme Court,” Washington University Journal of Law and Policy 25 (2007): 39–59, which focuses on the example of Harry Blackmun.

Chapter 4

Chief Justice Rehnquist was a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, and his quip about his performance during the Clinton impeachment came from a reference to the House of Lords in one of his favorite Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, Iolanthe.

The study of the Chief Justice's multiple duties was presented at a 2005 symposium on “the Chief Justice and the Institutional Judiciary,” sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, which devoted its June 2006 issue to the papers presented at the symposium.

Justice O'Connor's lecture was published as “Public Trust as a Dimension of Equal Justice, ” Court Review 36 (1999): 10–13. Chief Justice Rehnquist's comments on public opinion come from a lecture published as“Constitutional Law and Public Opinion,” Suffolk University Law Review 20 (1986): 751–69.

The Epstein and Martin article, “Does Public Opinion Influence the Supreme Court? Possibly Yes (But We're Not Sure Why)”was published in the University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law 13 (2010): 263–81. The “republican schoolmaster” image is from Ralph Lerner, “The Supreme Court as Republican Schoolmaster,” Supreme Court Review 1967(1967): 127–80. The study referred to on the issue of assisted suicide is from the chapter “The Right to Die” by Joshua A. Green and Matthew G. Jarvis, in Public Opinion and Constitutional Controversy, ed. Nathaniel Persily, Jack Citrin, and Patrick J. Egan(New York: Oxford University Press, 2008). The Persily book is also the source for the “legitimation hypothesis” mentioned in the text.

The results of the 2005 survey on public understanding of the courts are reported by Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Michael Hennessy in “Public Understanding of and Support for the Courts: Survey Results,” Georgetown Law Journal 95 (2007): 899–902. More recent surveys of students in grades four, six, and twelve, conducted by a unit of the U.S. Department of Education, continue to reveal similarly alarming gaps in knowledge about basic civics. See The Nation's Report Card: Civics 2010: National Assessment of Educational Progress at Grades 4, 6, and 12, issued in May 2011 by the National Center for Education Statistics and available at http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/main2010/2011466.pdf.

The 1972 Gallup Poll on attitudes toward abortion is discussed in Linda Greenhouse and Reva B. Siegel, Before Roe v. Wade: Voices That Shaped the Abortion Debate Before the Supreme Court's Ruling (New York: Kaplan, 2010). The political aftermath of the abortion decision is discussed in Linda Greenhouse and Reva B. Siegel, “Before (and After) Roe v. Wade: New Questions About Backlash,” Yale Law Journal 120 (2011): 2028–87.

Thomas Jefferson's objection to English law is discussed by David J. Seipp in his article, “Our Law, Their Law, History, and the Citation of Foreign Law,” Boston University Law Review 86 (2006): 1417–46. An article that offers a particularly useful comparative analysis in the modern context is John Ferejohn and Pasquale Pasquino's “Constitutional Adjudication: Lessons from Europe, ” Texas Law Review 82 (2003–2004): 1671–1704.

Cases cited

Supreme Court opinions are published by the government in a series of volumes called United States Reports. Opinions are identified by volume and page number. Thus, the official citation for Brown v. Board of Education is 347 U.S. 483 (1954). it appears beginning on page 483 of vol. 347 of United States Reports and was decided in 1954. In the Court's early decades, there was no United States Reports, and the volumes were known by the name of the Reporter (originally an unofficial, unpaid position) who published them. Thus, Marbury v. Madison is cited today as 1 Cranch(5 U.S.) 137 (1803) because the opinion appeared in a volume produced by William Cranch, the Court's second Reporter. (The first Reporter was Alexander J. Dallas, whose abbreviated name appears in the citations to the Court's earliest opinions.) The early volumes were retrospectively assigned “U.S.” volume numbers later in the nineteenth century, after Congress appropriated money to publish the series. The Court's Reporter of Decisions, as the official position is now known, is still responsible for overseeing the publication of accurate texts of opinions.
