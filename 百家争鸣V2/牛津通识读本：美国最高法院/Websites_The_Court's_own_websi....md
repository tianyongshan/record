Websites

The Court's own website, www.supremecourt.gov, is a user-friendly, continually updated source of information. Opinions and orders are posted within minutes after they are issued. In all cases accepted for argument, briefs are posted through a collaborative arrangement between the Court and the American Bar Association. The site includes argument schedules as well as an electronic docket that is rich in information about the status on pending petitions for certiorari, the dates when various briefs are due to be filed, as well as the ultimate disposition of each case. Transcripts of oral arguments are posted several hours after the argument has concluded. Every Friday of a week during which the justices are sitting, the Court posts the audio of all arguments heard during that week.

The website of the Oyez Project, www.oyez.org, maintained by the Illinois Institute of Technology/Chicago-Kent College of Law, is a free resource with a wide variety of current and historic materials, many in multimedia format. Another free site, Scotusblog, www.scotusblog.com(“Scotus” is a widely used acronym for “Supreme Court of the United States”) analyzes recent opinions, posts recently filed cert petitions, and provides a daily compilation of news and commentary about the Court. The Findlaw site, http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/index. html, while not as assiduously updated as Scotusblog, is also free and provides the text of opinions dating to the late nineteenth century.
