# 'Chinese beating African' and the 'low-human-right advantage' theory created by QinHui (秦晖)

to all the foreigners in this post, if you want to understand the real China, I recommend you to follow this genius historian, economist, and social scientist: Qin Hui (秦晖). He was in New York recently.
unfortunately, I don't know how much of his works have been translated into other languages. his works in Chinese are very logical and clear, but the scripts are very complex and difficult to be translated.
he knows not only about China, but many other countries all over the world, and he has very very logical and critical thinking ability.
So he has constructed some theories that could not only explain much of the Chinese history, but also could explain many important parts of the international history.
Such as his theory of 'low-human-right advantage', could explain:
(1) the economical origin of the US civil war;
(2) the development of eastern Europe in 1800s based on the serfs and the cheap products from the eastern Europe at that time flooded the western European market;
(3) The fast development of Southern Africa based on racism against black people;
(4) the fast development of China based on discriminating and oppressing the Migrant Workers and peasants which used to be more than half of the Chinese population;
And in 2008 he predicted that China's economy based on 'low-human-right advantage' will force the other developed countries to retreat from the globalization, to protect their own products. It is happening now.
And now China are exporting this mode of 'low-human-right advantage' to other countries. If without other context our present understanding of this video in this post is correct (some Chinese company abusing the African worker in Africa), then this is a typical case of China exporting the mode 'low-human-right advantage' to another country.
QinHui pointed out that, some western people now are too obsessed with the 'identity politics', such as one race oppressing another race, one religion against another religion.
Such as China government oppressing Uighurs has attracted much international attention.
However the western people are insensitive to the human right violation inside a race or nation, such as the systematic human right violation to the Chinese peasants and migrant labors, which is more fundamental and larger issue but it got less international attention.
This is why the western people's critics to Chinese Communist Party's oppressing Uighurs hasn't gotten much response from the Chinese people,
